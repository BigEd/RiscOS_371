Draw is a powerful and sophisticated drawing package; you can use
it to draw and edit diagrams and pictures made up from various
kinds of graphical objects.
<P>
<A NAME="MARKER-2-64">You'll probably find that the easiest way
of learning Draw is to read through Basic ideas (on the next page)
and then work through the <A HREF="D_5A.HTM">Draw tutorial </A>, before
reading the more detailed sections.</A>
<A NAME="MARKER-9-65"> </A>
<H2><A NAME="HEADING5-3">Starting Draw </A></H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG22" WIDTH=29 HEIGHT=27> Draw is in the Apps icon bar directory
display. <A NAME="MARKER-2-66">To start Draw</B>: </A>
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>1 Double-click on the !Draw icon, to install it on the icon
bar. 
<DT>
<DD>2 Click on the Draw icon bar icon to open a new <A NAME="MARKER-2-67">Draw
window. 
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG23" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=173>

<P>
Alternatively, edit an existing drawing by <A NAME="MARKER-2-68">dragging

on it.</A>
<H2><A NAME="HEADING5_8">Basic ideas </A></H2>
<H3><A NAME="HEADING5_9">The Draw window </A></H3>
<P>
The <A NAME="MARKER-2-69">Draw window looks similar to other application
windows when you first load it, except that down its lefthand
side there is a strip of icons called the </A><A NAME="MARKER-2-70">Toolbox.
The Toolbox allows you to draw or select objects without having
to use menus.</A>
<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG24" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=175> 
<H3><A NAME="HEADING5_11">Draw objects </A></H3>
<P>
A Draw diagram is built up from <A NAME="MARKER-2-71">objects
of a number of different types. Draw stores information about
each object, which means you can subsequently change individual
objects without affecting the other objects.</A>
<P>
The basic object types are</B>:
<UL>

<LI><A NAME="MARKER-2-72"><B>Paths</B>, consisting of a sequence of </A><A NAME="MARKER-2-73">line
segments. Each line segment can be straight or </A><A NAME="MARKER-2-74">curved.
A path can be closed to form a </A><A NAME="MARKER-2-75">polygon
or curved object, or left </A><A NAME="MARKER-2-76">open. The
path is the basic element of a drawing. 
</A>

<LI><B>Rectangles</B> and <B>ellipses</B>, which are also path objects. This means that you can edit them.

<LI><A NAME="MARKER-2-79"><B>Text lines</B>, in a range of fonts and
sizes. 
</A>

<LI><A NAME="MARKER-2-80"><B>Text areas</B>, consisting of several lines
of text. </A><A NAME="MARKER-2-81">Text areas can be used for
simple desktop publishing, and for annotating drawings. 
</A>

<LI><B>Sprites</B>, which are graphic shapes made up of an array of coloured
pixels. You can create <A NAME="MARKER-2-82">sprites using Paint
(see next chapter) and then load them into Draw. 
</A>

<LI><A NAME="MARKER-2-84"><B>JPEG</B> files (compressed photographic
images) such as those in the <CODE>Images</CODE> directory. 
</A>
</UL>
<P>
You can combine objects together as a <A NAME="MARKER-2-85">group
which you can then (usually) manipulate like any other object.
Draw records the objects that were used to build a group, so that
it may subsequently be 'ungrouped' into its constituents. Groups
can also be used as components of other groups.</A>
<P>
Each object has a style consisting of a number of <A NAME="MARKER-2-87"><I>attributes</I>.
Attributes are used to define the </A><A NAME="MARKER-2-88">colours
of an object, </A><A NAME="MARKER-2-89">line widths, text </A><A NAME="MARKER-2-90">fonts
and sizes, and so on. The exact range of attributes depends on
the type of object.</A>
<H3><A NAME="HEADING5_22">Draw modes </A></H3>
<P>
You can use Draw in three operating <A NAME="MARKER-2-91">modes</B>:</A>
<UL>

<LI><A NAME="MARKER-2-92"><B>Enter mode</B> - used to create new Draw
objects (like lines and squares).  
</A>

<LI><A NAME="MARKER-2-93"><B>Select mode</B> - used to change object
attributes (like line colour) and to move and alter objects. 
</A>

<LI><B>Path edit</B> mode - used to reshape an object by altering its
paths and segments. 
</UL>
<P>
Don't worry about these names too much - when you're actually using Draw you'll change between the modes without thinking about
it!
<P>
The <A NAME="MARKER-2-95">mouse pointer changes according to which
mode you are using</B>: in Enter mode it is shown as a star, and in
Select and Path edit mode as an arrow.</A>
<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG25" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=32> 
<H3><A NAME="HEADING5_29">Tools and short-cuts </A></H3>
<P>
To make it easier to construct a diagram, Draw has a number of
<A NAME="MARKER-2-96">tools and shortcuts</B>:</A>
<UL>

<LI>The <A NAME="MARKER-2-97"><B>Toolbox</B> is attached to the lefthand
edge of each Draw window. You can use this to draw and edit shapes,
without having to use menus. 
</A>

<LI>You can display a <A NAME="MARKER-2-98"><B>Grid</B> to help
you align objects in a diagram. Various different sizes and shapes
of grid are available. 
</A>

<LI><A NAME="MARKER-2-99"> </A><B>Keyboard short-cuts</B> duplicate the effect
of the more frequent Draw actions. These are listed at the end
of this chapter on <A HREF=#MARKER-9-263>page 259</A>, and
also appear alongside the corresponding menu entries on the screen.


<LI>You can use <A NAME="MARKER-2-100"><B>New view</B> to display more
than one view of a diagram; different views can have different
grid and zoom factor settings. Changes made to the drawing in
one view affect the other view as well.  
</A>
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="HEADING5_35">The drawing area </A></H3>
<P>
When you start a drawing, the Draw window displayed on your screen
only shows part of your actual drawing area. The drawing area
is usually the size of an A4 sheet of paper, but you can make
it as small as A5 or as large as A0, depending on the size of
the drawing you want to create. You can also decide whether the
drawing area is a <A NAME="MARKER-2-104">landscape rectangle (where
the horizontal side is longer) or a </A><A NAME="MARKER-2-105">portrait
rectangle (where the vertical side is longer). You can use the
scroll bars on the Draw window to move around the drawing area.</A>

Note each region's direction as you draw it, clockwise or anti-clockwise,
and give this direction a number</B>: +1 for one direction and -1

To see if a region is to be filled, construct an imaginary line
from inside the region to outside the object. Keep a total of
the direction values for each line it crosses. If the total is
non-zero, the region will be filled (see the diagram overleaf).

<H2><A NAME="HEADING5_458">Text areas </A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="MARKER-9-241">A </A><A NAME="MARKER-2-242">text area
is a special sort of object that allows you to perform simple
'desktop publishing'. A text area consists of a piece of text
divided into one or more rectangular regions called </A><A NAME="MARKER-9-243"><B>text
columns</B>. Draw breaks up the text into lines which are just wide
enough to fit into the columns, splitting it (principally) at
spaces.</A>
<P>
You can create a text area by using Edit (for example) to prepare
a file containing the text, annotated with special commands (described
below). When you load the text file into Draw, the text is formatted
into columns. The number of columns is given by an annotation.
You can move the text columns and change their size in Select
mode. As you do this, Draw will reformat the text between the
columns. 
<P>
Text areas only use anti-aliased fonts</B>: you cannot create a text
area in the system font. If you try to use the system font you
will find that it is automatically converted into the Trinity
font. See <I>Default text area header</I> on <A HREF=#MARKER-9-254>page 256</A>.
If you want to create a text area in system font, use the outline
font version of the system font</B>: choose <B>Style</B>/<B>Font name</B>/<B>System</B>/<B>Fixed</B>.
<H3><A NAME="HEADING5_463">Creating and editing text areas </A>
</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/D5IMA160" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=27> To create a text area from a text
file, drag the file into a Draw window. The columns in the text
area are initially set up to standard sizes. If you drag the text
file over the top of a selected text area, the old text in the
area is replaced with the contents of the new file. Use this method
for altering the text in a text area.
<P>
Text area selection works in two slightly different ways, depending
on how many text columns there are in the text area</B>:
<H4><A NAME="HEADING5_466">Single text columns </A></H4>
<P>
When there is a single <A NAME="MARKER-9-244">text column in the
text area, selection works in the same way as any other object.
You can move the text area, scale it, change its style, and so
on, as described above.</A>
<H4><A NAME="MARKER-9-245">Multiple text columns </A></H4>
<P>
When there is more than one text column, <A NAME="MARKER-9-246">selection
is a two-stage process. When you first click (or click Adjust,
in multiple object selection) over the text area, the entire area
is selected. You can move the area, but it cannot be scaled. Double-click
(or double-click Adjust) to select a column of the text area.
You can move and scale individual columns. Their new position
and size need not lie within the original text area. </A>
<P>
When you change the size of a text column, the text is reformatted
to fit the new size of the column. 
<P>
To select more than one column of a text area, select the first
as described above, and select further ones by first clicking
Adjust and then double-clicking Select over the column.
<P>
You can't rotate text areas and text columns (they don't have
rotate handles).
<P>
Some select mode actions cannot be applied to text columns. If
there are any text columns selected when you perform the operation,
they are deselected first. An example of this is object deletion</B>:
you can delete a <A NAME="MARKER-9-247">text area as a whole,
but not a text column from within it.</A>
<H3><A NAME="HEADING5_474">An example </A></H3>
<P>
Try typing the following text into Edit and loading it into Draw
as an Edit file</B>:
<P><CODE>
\! 1<P>
\AD<P>
\D2<P>
\F0 Trinity.Medium 24<P>
\L24<P>
\P24<P></CODE>
<P>
This is an example of a text area containing two columns. The
text was prepared in Edit, and then saved directly into Draw.
The columns were then stretched to the right size, using select
mode, and the rectangles added.
<P>
This creates the following text area</B>:
<P> <IMG SRC="PICS2/D5IMA161" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=174>
<P>
The appearance of a text area is determined from commands which
are included in the text used to create it. Each command starts
with a backslash (\) character. The full list of sequences is
given below, but the following is a brief description of the commands
used in the example. 
<UL>

<LI>\! 1 tells Draw that this is a text area. 

<LI>\AD causes the text to be justified to left and right in its
columns. 

<LI>\D2 indicates the number of columns to be displayed. 

<LI>\F0 Trinity.Medium 24 specifies font 0 as Trinity.Medium,
24pt. 

<LI>\L24 sets the line spacing to 24pt. 

<LI>\P24 sets the spacing between paragraphs to 24pt. In this
example, this just affects the space after the title. 

<LI>\0 selects font 0 for the following text. 
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="MARKER-9-248">Text area commands </A></H3>
<P>
The following is a complete list of <A NAME="MARKER-9-249">text
area commands. Some commands must be terminated with either a
newline or a slash (/) character. Others do not need a terminator
(for example, where the command has a fixed number of characters)
but may optionally end with a slash character. For clarity, it
is often useful to include it. <B>Note especially that all commands
are case sensitive</B>: this is unusual in RISC OS and applications
written for it.</A>
<P>
In the following descriptions
<UL>

<LI>Items in italics (for example code) indicate a parameter you
must supply. 

<LI>Items in square brackets are optional (for example [/] indicates
an optional slash character). 

<LI>Commands and parameters must normally be separated by spaces
(though there does not have to be a space between the command
and the first parameter). 

<LI>Return means a single newline character,
and Return/ means newline or /.  
</UL>
<P>
Here's the full list of annotations</B>:
<P>
<B>Commands and their effects:</B><P><UL>

<LI><B>\! version Return/</B>: This is a special line which must appear at the start of any file which is to be used for a text area. version must be 1. However, it forms part of a default header which is inserted at the start of the text; this is described below.


<LI><B>\A code [/]</B>: Set alignment. code may be L (left aligned), R (right aligned), C (centred) or D (double, i.e. justified to both margins). An alignment setting forces a line break. The default setting is left aligned.


<LI><B>\B red green blue Return/
</B>: Set the background colour to the given red/green/blue intensity, or the best available approximation. Each intensity is in the range 0 to 255; values outside this range will be limited to it (i.e. a value set higher than 255 will be realised as 255; a value set to less than 0 will be realised as 0). Background colour is used in the same way as for text objects; you should set it to be the same as the area of the drawing that the text area is to appear in front of (the text area itself is effectively transparent). The default is the background style attribute of the text area object, normally white (equivalent to \B 255 255 255).


<LI><B>\C red green blue Return/
</B>: Set the text colour to the given red/green/blue intensity, or the best available approximation. Each intensity is in the range 0 to 255; values outside this range will be limited to it. The default is the text colour style attribute of the text area object, normally black (equivalent to \C 0 0 0).


<LI><B>\D columns Return/</B>: Indicates that the text area is to contain the indicated number of columns. This must appear before any printing text. The default is 1.


<LI><B>\F font-number name size [width] Return/
</B>: Defines a font reference. font-number is either one or two digits. The font number is used subsequently to set the font. name is a font name such as Trinity.Medium. size and width are the height and width of the font in points. If width is omitted, the size is used for both height and width. There are no defaults.


<LI><B>\font-number [/]</B>: Indicates that the text from the point at which the command appears is to appear in the specified font. If the font is not available when the text is being drawn, the effect is undefined. Draw will attempt to check that the font number and the corresponding definition are reasonable. There is no default.


<LI><B>\L line-spacing Return/
</B>: Sets the line spacing (the distance from the base of the characters in one line to the base of the characters in the next) to the given value, measured in points. Line spacing changes take effect from the end of the output line in which the command appears. The default is 10pt.


<LI><B>\M left-margin right-margin Return
</B>: Sets the left and right margins to the given values, measured in points. If the total size of the margins is greater than the width of the column, no text is displayed. Margin settings apply from the end of the output line in which the command appears. The default is 1pt at each side.


<LI><B>\P paragraph-spacing Return
</B>: Sets the extra space inserted between paragraphs to the given value, measured in points. Paragraph spacing changes take effect from the end of the output paragraph in which they appear. The default is 10pt.


<LI><B>\U position thickness Return
</B>: Switches on underlining, at the given position relative to the base of the characters. position is limited to the range -128 to 127, and thickness to the range 0 to 255. Both values are measured in units of 1/256 of the current font size. Underlining may be turned off by specifying a thickness of 0.


<LI><B>\U. [/]</B>: An alternative way of turning underlining off.


<LI><B>\V[-] vertical-move [/]</B>: Moves the following text by the given amount, measured in points, relative to the current character position. This is intended for superscripts and subscripts; use positive values for superscripts, negative values for subscripts.


<LI><B>\-</B>: Inserts a soft hyphen. This tells Draw that it may split the word at this point if necessary, inserting a hyphen character in the output. If the word is not split at the soft hyphen, it has no printing effect.


<LI><B>\Return</B>: Forces a line break.


<LI><B>\\</B>: Inserts a backslash character.

<LI><B>\;text Return</B>: Treated as a comment. Characters up to and including the next newline are ignored.

<LI>A sequence of n newline characters in the body of the text
inserts n-1 paragraph spacings. 
</UL>
<P>
For columns other than the first, paragraph spacings at the head
of the column are ignored. Lines which protrude vertically beyond
the limits of the column are not displayed; however, all commands
occurring in them are interpreted. This can occur if the line
spacing is significantly smaller than the font height. You should
take care (by using the \M command) to ensure that lines do not
protrude beyond the limits of the column horizontally, since the
text may not be displayed correctly in this case. The only circumstances
in which this is likely to happen are when an italic font is used
and the margin setting does not allow for it.
<H4><A NAME="MARKER-9-252">Font usage </A></H4>

and is a standard format for compressing photographic images (see
the pictures in the <CODE>Images</CODE> directory, for example).</A>
<P>
Unlike Paint, if you load a JPEG into Draw, all the original file
information is kept. This means, amongst other things, that you
can save an imported image back out of Draw as a JPEG file again.
It also means that if you change from one screen mode to another
with more colours, you'll see an imported JPEG file at a higher
quality.
<P>
When you display a DrawFile containing a JPEG object, the graphics
system requires some workspace for processing the JPEG data. You
can see this on your Tasks display as the dynamic area 'JPEG Workspace',
and its required size depends on the width in pixels of your JPEG
image.
<P>
If there is insufficient free memory to allocate this workspace,
Draw displays a JPEG image as a light grey rectangle containing
the message 'Not enough memory available to plot JPEG'.
<P>
Some third-party applications not updated to use the JPEG features
of RISC OS 3 will correctly load a DrawFile containing a JPEG
image, but display a blank box where the JPEG image should be.
Other applications may fail to load such a DrawFile.
<P>
If this is a problem, use !Paint or !ChangeFSI to convert your
JPEG images into sprites, and replace the JPEG images in your
DrawFile with these sprites. This can produce a DrawFile of the
same appearance, but using far more space on disc and in your
computer's memory to store.

can be 'active' at a time. So, if you select an object in one
window and then select an object in another window, you will nullify
the selection in the first window. Additionally clicking on the
Draw icon to create another Draw window also nullifies any current
selection.

<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/D5IMA162" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=26> You <A NAME="MARKER-2-261">may
want to change some aspects of the way new Draw windows appear.
For example, a new window normally opens with the Joined line
tool selected, but you may prefer to have the Select tool ready
to use each time you start Draw.</A>
<P>
You can set features of this type by setting up Draw as you want
to use it, then save these features by creating a <A NAME="MARKER-2-262">Desktop
boot file. Instructions on how to create a Desktop boot file are
given in </A><A HREF="../BOOKB/BOOK_5.HTM#HEADING5-7"><I>Desktop boot files</I> on page 51</A>.
<P>
There are several features of Draw that you can set before saving
a Desktop boot file, so that they are set up the way you want
them each time you switch on. The Draw features that will be recorded
when you go through this process are known as Draw$Options (see
<A HREF="../Book3b/BOOK3_6.HT#HEADING6-0"><I>Configuring applications</I> on page 427</A>).
