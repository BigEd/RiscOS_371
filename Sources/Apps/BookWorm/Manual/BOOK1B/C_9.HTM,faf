T1ToFont is a program that converts fonts from <A NAME=MARKER-2-2> </A><A NAME=MARKER-2-3> </A>Adobe Type1 format to the RISC OS <A NAME=MARKER-2-4> </A>outline font format. Once you've converted fonts, you can use them in your documents just like any other Acorn <A NAME=MARKER-2-5> </A>outline font.<P>
<B>Note</B></B>: This application is for advanced users <B>only</B>. Most people will never need to use it. Some complex fonts (and fonts not conforming exactly to Adobe Type 1 format) may not convert successfully.<P>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-6> </A>This application should only be used to convert public domain fonts. While it is possible to convert proprietary fonts, it would, most probably, be a breach of copyright to do so without the consent of the copyright holder.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING9-4> </A>
<H2> Converting a font</H2>
Before you can use the <A NAME=MARKER-2-7> </A>converter you need to have your source font (the Type 1 file and the AFM file, described on <A HREF=#MARKER-9-18>page 171</A>) on a RISC OS format disc. The Type 1 file (often called the PFB file) should be given the filetype <A NAME=MARKER-2-8> </A><B>PoScript</B> and the AFM file given the filetype <B>Text</B>.<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>1  Load T1ToFont (it's in the Utilities directory on your hard disc or network).<P>
<DT><DD>2  Click on the icon bar icon to display the Font converter window.<P><IMG SRC="PICS3/C9IMA157" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=118>  <P>
<DT><DD>3  Drag the Type 1 PFB file icon from its directory display onto the <B>Type 1 file</B> field in the converter window.<P>
<DT><DD>4  Drag the AFM file from its directory display onto the <B>AFM file</B> field in the converter window.<P>
<DT><DD>5  After a few seconds the name of the RISC OS font to be generated is displayed in the <B>Font name</B> field. You can change this name if required.<P>
<DT><DD>6  Use the <B>Save in</B> field to select a font directory to save the resulting font in. However you should not normally change this from the default path - typically <CODE>ADFS::HardDisc4.$.!BOOT.Resources.!Fonts</CODE>. Click on the menu icon to display the alternatives. <P>
<DT><DD>7  Select the <B>Encoding</B> you need for the font, <B>Acorn Extended Latin</B> is nearly always used. Click on the menu icon to display the alternatives.<P>
<DT><DD>8  Click on the <B>Keep <A NAME=MARKER-2-9> </A>PostScript</B> option button if you want to keep the Type1 font and the AFM files with the Outline font. This is useful if you are printing to a PostScript printer as the printer will then use the PostScript font directly.<P>
<DT><DD>9  Start the conversion by clicking on <B>OK</B>. <P>
</DL>
When the conversion is finished (the hourglass reverts back to a pointer) the font is now stored in the computer as a RISC OS font. <P>
You should now try to display the font using !Chars (see <A HREF="../Book2ab/E_7.HTM#HEADING7-0">page 351</A>) if the font displays correctly the conversion was successful. If the font does not display properly then it cannot be used with RISC OS and should be deleted from the font directory it was saved in.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING9-17> </A>
<H3> Other information</H3>
The <B>Save in</B> menu selects a font directory to save the resulting font in. The menu is constructed from the contents of the Font$Path system variable, so !Font directories can be added to the menu by installing them on Font$Path (you can do this by double-clicking them). The default path is <CODE>ADFS::HardDisc4.$.!BOOT.Resources.!Fonts</CODE>.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING9-19> </A>
<H4> Encoding</H4>
The <B>Encoding</B> type for most fonts will almost always be <B>Acorn Extended Latin</B>.<P>
Some fonts have their own special encoding information. If you have one of these fonts you should choose the Encoding type, <B>As specified in type 1 file</B>.<P>
If you don't have an AFM file you can convert the font by leaving the AFM field blank. The resulting font will lack kerning (font spacing) information, so always use the AFM file if you have one. <P>
Selwyn, Sussex and Sidney are encodings for special <A NAME=MARKER-2-10> </A>symbol fonts. The <A NAME=MARKER-2-11> </A>encoding file is automatically stored within the font's directory. <P>
<A NAME=HEADING9-24> </A>
<H4> Font types</H4>
Fonts must conform strictly to the <A NAME=MARKER-2-12> </A>Type 1 font definitions. Many <A NAME=MARKER-2-13> </A>Public Domain fonts do not obey the structure rules laid down by Adobe and consequently they may not convert properly. <A NAME=MARKER-2-14> </A>Type 3 fonts cannot be converted.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING9-26> </A>
<H4> Printing to a PostScript printer</H4>
If you print to a <A NAME=MARKER-2-15> </A>Postscript printer, the printer uses the original PostScript font (for downloading) if it is available. If it is not available, it converts and downloads the RISC OS outline font. To keep the original PostScript font available, select the <B>Keep PostScript</B> option before you start converting your font.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING9-28> </A>
<H2> Using Macintosh and MS-DOS type 1 fonts</H2>
<A NAME=HEADING9-29> </A>
<H3> <A NAME=MARKER-2-16> </A>Macintosh fonts</H3>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-17> </A>Macintosh fonts are generally supplied as a Font/DA Mover document, containing the Macintosh version of the font, and one or more Type 1 files containing the PostScript code for use on the printer. There will be one Type 1 file for each weight and variation of the font.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING9-31> </A>
<H4> <A NAME=MARKER-9-18> </A>AFM file</H4>
In addition to this you need an <A NAME=MARKER-9-19> </A>AFM (Adobe Font Metrics) file for each weight and variation of the font. The Macintosh does not seem to use this itself, but some fonts are supplied with it anyway. If you do not have the AFM file, contact the font supplier and try to obtain one.<P>
You can convert a font without using an AFM file, however the resultant RISC OS font will lack kerning information.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING9-34> </A>
<H4> Transfer the files</H4>
You need to copy files from the Macintosh to your computer. Macintosh Type 1 files usually occupy the Macintosh resource fork of the file, so you'll need a way to extract this. The Macintosh version of the file transfer protocol Kermit, is one way of doing this. It may be simpler to use a Macintosh multiformat floppy drive to copy the files to an MS-DOS format floppy disc. This disc can then be read directly by your RISC OS computer.<P>
Transfer the resource fork of the font file to a file on your computer, and set its filetype to PoScript (&amp;FF4). Transfer the AFM file (usually in the data fork) to your computer and give it the filetype Text.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING9-37> </A>
<H3> <A NAME=MARKER-2-20> </A>MS-DOS Fonts</H3>
Fonts for MS-DOS computers are supplied on MS-DOS floppy discs and can therefore be read directly by the RISC OS Filer. Among the files on the disc will be one or more Type 1 files containing the PostScript code for the printer. There will be one Type 1 file for each weight and variation of the font. The Type 1 files usually have the extension<CODE> .PFB</CODE>. <P>
<A NAME=HEADING9-39> </A>
<H4> AFM file</H4>
In addition to this you need an AFM (Adobe Font Metrics) file for each weight and variation of the font. If you do not have the AFM file, contact the font supplier and try to obtain one. <P>
You can convert a font without using an AFM file, although the resultant RISC OS font will lack kerning information.<P>
Other files on the disc, including the PFM file, are not needed for the conversion.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING9-43> </A>
<H4> Setting the filetypes</H4>
Transfer the AFM and <A NAME=MARKER-2-21> </A>PFB files to another floppy disc or to the hard disc. Change the filetype of the PFB file to PoScript (&amp;FF4) and the filetype of the AFM file to Text.<P>
