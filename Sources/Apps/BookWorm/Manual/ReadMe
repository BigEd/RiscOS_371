=====================================================

Verion 1.00

This ReadMe file provides extra information on RISC OS 3.70 and
the StrongARM processor, not covered in the printed documentation. 

The Manuals directory contains the RISC OS User Guide ,read

The Replay directory contains a !ReadMe describing the more
advanced feature of the Replay software supplied.

It is particularly important that you check this ReadMe for any
patches or fixes that need to be made.

  1) Patches - a list of the application incompatibilities that can be
  readily fixed by applying the supplied patches.

  2) SSound - a warning

  3) Compatibility - a list of Acorn applications and hardware expansions that
  are known to work, or not to work, with RISC OS 3.70 and StrongARM.

  4) Troubleshooting - some suggestions if there are problems.


1) Patches
----------

Here is a list of the patches supplied with the RISC OS 3.7 upgrade. These
fix compatibility problems either with RISC OS 3.7 or with the StrongARM
processor. You can find the patches in the Utilities.Patches directory after
performing the upgrade.

In general, it is wise to make sure you have a backup of any items before
applying the patches.

Advance

To patch Advance 1.01 for RISC OS 3.7, run the !Patch application, and drag
your copy of !Advance onto the !Patch icon.

PocketFS

To patch PocketFS 2.03 for RISC OS 3.7, run the !Patch application, and drag
your copy of !PocketFS onto the !Patch icon.

ansilib

A new version of ansilib for those with the Acorn C/C++ toolkit. See the
ReadMe file in Utilities.Patches.ansilib.

CallASWI

A support module for backward compatibility with older versions of RISC OS.
You do not need this item unless you are writing software for release. See
Utilities.Patches.CallASWI.ReadMe for details.

SCSIDM

A version of ScsiDM relinked to work with StrongARM. See the ReadMe file in
Utilities.Patches.SCSIDM

SparkFS

The new components required to patch !SparkFS 1.27 for use with StrongARM.
See the ReadMe file in Utilities.Patches.SparkFS.

SSound

A new version of the shared sound module, which works with StrongARM. See
the ReadMe file in Utilities.Patches.SSound.


2) SSound - warning
-------------------

If you try to use a version of SSound earlier than Vs. 0.24 on a StrongARM
machine, it will crash - don't  panic! Vs. 0.24 of SSound is supplied in 
Utilities.patches.SSound. 



3) Compatibility
----------------

Here is a list of Acorn applications and hardware that are known to work - or not
to work - with StrongARM and RISC OS 3.7, together with any details of
possible upgrades. More up to date information may be available on the ART
web pages ( see http://www.art.acorn.co.uk/ ).

Acorn C/C++ - works on StrongARM. A new version of ansilib for StrongARM is
supplied in Utilities.Patches (remember, ansilib is _not_ for production
code).

Advance 1.01 - works on RISC OS 3.70 after patching. 

TCP/IP Release 2 - works on StrongARM, after patching the protocol modules.
See Utilities.Patches.TCP/IP.

OmniClient - works on StrongARM. 

AUN Level 4 - works on StrongARM.

PocketFS - version 2.03 works on StrongARM, after patching with
Utilities.!Patch.

PCx86 - versions 1.91 or later have been tested and confirmed as working.
Upgrades are available free of charge from the Acorn FTP site, or at low
cost via dealers (as product code ACA54).

DTP - does not work on StrongARM

First Word Plus - does not work on StrongARM

Ethernet cards - cards that have been purchased from i-cubed Ltd directly,
or i-cubed cards that have been Acorn badged should work correctly. ANT
cards that have been bought from Atomwide Ltd, or Acorn badged ANT cards
will require a ROM upgrade. This applies to both 'NIC' and 'Podule'
variants. Please refer to your dealer for further information about upgrades
to these or the situation regarding other manufacturers' cards.




9) Troubleshooting
------------------

In case you encounter problems, here is a list of symptoms, with
probable reasons and remedies.


** The machine does not show any signs of life

   Reasons                                 Remedies

           
   * An incompatible expansion card or     Remove all expansion cards and  
     network card is fitted                re-install one at a time to identify
                                           incompatible card(s).
           

** The software I want to use does not work

                                           Check the Utilities.Patches directory
                                           supplied in the new disc installation;
                                           there may be a patch for your software.

                                           Contact the software developer for an
                                           upgrade or patch.

                                           Try turning the cache off (press f12 
                                           and type *cache off), though the
                                           performance is likely to be poor.

                                           The ARM Club are planning to release a 
                                           new software package which will enable 
                                           some software to run on a StrongARM 
                                           which would otherwise be incompatible.
                                           This should be available from:
