<HR>
Paint is a pixel-based picture editor; you can use it to 'paint' coloured images by applying colours to an area with a variety of brushes and painting tools.<P>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-43>You'll</A> probably find that the easiest way of learning Paint is to read through <A HREF=#MARKER-9-47> <I>Basic ideas</I></A> (on the next page) and then work through the <A HREF="../BOOK2AB/E_2A.HTM#HEADING2-20"><I>Paint tutorial</I></A> which follows, before coming back to the <A HREF=#MARKER-9-95><I>Paint reference section</I></A> starting on <A HREF=#MARKER-9-95>page 297</A>.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-3> </A>
<H2> Starting Paint</H2>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/E2IMAGE2" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=27>  <A NAME=MARKER-2-44> </A>Paint is in the Apps icon bar directory display. To start Paint and create a new sprite</B>: <P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>1  Double-click on the !Paint icon to install it on the icon bar.<P>
<DT><DD>2  Click on the Paint icon bar icon to display the Create new sprite window.<P><IMG SRC="PICS3/E2IMAGE3" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=179>  <P>
<DT><DD>3  Fill in the details for your new <A NAME=MARKER-2-45> </A>sprite and click on <B>OK</B> (it's probably best to follow the tutorial starting on <A HREF="../BOOK2AB/E_2A.HTM#MARKER-9-57">page 285</A> if you don't already know how to do this).<P>
</DL>
Alternatively, edit an existing sprite file by <A NAME=MARKER-2-46> </A>dragging its file icon to the Paint icon on the icon bar, or by double-clicking on it.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-9> </A>
<H2> <A NAME=MARKER-9-47> </A>Basic ideas</H2>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/E2IMAGE4" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=27>  The pictures produced by <A NAME=MARKER-2-48> </A>Paint are called <I><A NAME=MARKER-2-49> </A>sprites</I>. <P>
A <A NAME=MARKER-2-50> </A>sprite is a graphic shape made up of an arrangement of <A NAME=MARKER-2-51> </A>pixels (the smallest unit the screen uses in its current mode). Sprites are stored in <I>sprite files</I>, which can contain more than one sprite. Sprites and sprite files use a standard format, so you can freely export images produced by Paint to other RISC OS applications (such as Draw) that recognise sprites. You can also use Paint to edit sprites produced by other RISC OS applications, and to import and edit <A NAME=MARKER-2-52> </A>JPEG files.<P>
The important difference between Paint and Draw is that, unlike Draw, Paint knows nothing about 'objects' such as rectangles and circles; all it knows is the colour of each pixel in a sprite. Although you can paint regular shapes, you cannot then select them in order to delete, move or resize them.<P>
When you export (save) a sprite from Paint into Draw, this remains true</B>: regular shapes forming part of the sprite cannot be edited like Draw objects. The whole sprite becomes a single object in your Draw diagram; you can move or resize it, but not otherwise edit it.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-14> </A>
<H3> Choosing colours in Paint</H3>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-53> </A>Paint can create and edit pictures in any RISC OS screen mode</B>: 16 million colours, 32 thousand colours, 256 colours, 16 colours, 4 greys and black and white. There are two different ways of choosing colours in a sprite</B>:<P>
<UL>

<LI>Sprites created in up to 256 colours use a Colours window, familiar to users of previous versions of RISC OS (the Paint tutorial uses this method - see <A HREF="../BOOK2AB/E_2A.HTM#MARKER-9-68">page 287</A>).<P>

<LI>32-thousand and 16-million colour sprites make use of the <A NAME=MARKER-2-54> </A>Colours window described in <A HREF="../BOOK2B/D_3.HTM#MARKER-9-1"><I>Using colour in applications</I> on page 179</A>.<P>
</UL>
<A NAME=HEADING2-18> </A>
<H3> Creating sprite files compatible with earlier versions of RISC OS</H3>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-55> </A>If you want to create sprite files that are compatible with earlier versions of RISC OS, make sure you choose a sprite type that has an equivalent old-type <A NAME=MARKER-2-56> </A>mode number. See <A HREF=#MARKER-9-148>page 315</A> for more information.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-20> </A>
<H1> <A NAME=MARKER-9-95> </A>Paint reference section</H1>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG34" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=27>  This section tells you in detail how to use Paint, and outlines the terms, concepts and basic techniques for creating and editing sprites. For a brief introduction to Paint and sprites, see <A HREF=#MARKER-9-47><I>Basic ideas</I> on page 284</A>.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-151> </A>
<H4> Paint has several windows with specialised functions</B>:</H4>
<UL>

<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-9-96> </A>Create new sprite</B> window - Use this to set up a new sprite.<P>

<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-9-97> </A>Sprite file window</B> - Think of this as a sort of Paint 'directory'; it can contain more than one sprite (see <A HREF=#MARKER-9-104>page 299</A>). <P>

<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-9-98> </A>Sprite</B> window - This is like any other application window (e.g. a Draw window)</B>: It contains the current file (in this case, a sprite) you're editing.<P>

<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-9-99> </A>Colours</B> window - You use this in conjunction with the tools window to change the colour of pixels in a sprite.<P>

<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-9-100> </A>Paint tools</B> window - This contains the different tools you use to edit a sprite's pixels.<P>
</UL>
<A NAME=HEADING2-157> </A>
<H2> <A NAME=MARKER-9-101> </A>Creating a new sprite</H2>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-102> </A>To create a new sprite</B>:<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>1  Click on the Paint icon on the icon bar.<P>
<DT><DD>2  Define the sprite's <A NAME=MARKER-9-103> </A>attributes in the Create new sprite window</B>:<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG35" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=162>  <P>
</DL>
The table overleaf tells you what all the options in this dialogue box mean.<P>

<P><B>To</B>: </B><P><UL>
<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-9-1> </A>Name a new sprite</B>: Fill in the <B>Name</B> box. Sprite names can be up to 12 characters long.
<LI><B>Allow a sprite to use transparent pixels, as well as coloured ones</B>: Switch the <B>Mask</B> option on. This defines an extra 'colour' in the Colours window. Pixels painted in this colour are <A NAME=MARKER-9-2> </A>transparent.
<LI><B>Define the <A NAME=MARKER-9-3> </A>size of the sprite in pixels</B>: Fill in the <B>Width</B> and <B>Height</B> boxes<A HREF="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</A>. The default is the size of the current display.<P>You can also click on the resize arrows at the bottom of the window.<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG36" WIDTH=125 HEIGHT=55>  
<LI><B>Change the <A NAME=MARKER-9-4> </A>pixel size</B>: Choose from <B>45</B>, <B>90</B> and <B>180</B> dots per inch (dpi). Larger dpi settings give smaller pixels (hence a smaller canvas).
<LI><B>Set the number of <A NAME=MARKER-9-5> </A>colours in the sprite</B>: Choose from <B>2</B>, <B>4</B>, <B>16</B>, <B>256</B>, <B>32K</B> or <B>16M.</B></B>Usually the same as in the current display mode.
<LI><B>Define whether the sprite uses a <A NAME=MARKER-9-6> </A>palette</B>: Choose <A NAME=MARKER-2-7> </A><B>colour</B> for backward compatibility with earlier versions of RISC OS, <B>mono</B> for grey shades or <B>none</B> for the default palette. You can't set a palette in 32K and 16M modes. <P>Colour sprites with a palette have white as colour 0; mono sprites have black as colour 0. Mono palettes may not display correctly on earlier operating systems.</UL>
<P>
<B>Note</B></B>: You can normally ignore the <B>colours (mode)</B> box. If there's a number shown here, the sprite is created as an old format sprite. If it's blank, the sprite created is a new format sprite.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-164> </A>
<H2> <A NAME=MARKER-9-104> </A>Handling sprite files</H2>
It's easy to become confused over the difference between sprites and <A NAME=MARKER-2-105> </A>sprite files. This section shows you how to create and manipulate sprites and sprite files.<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG37" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=94>  <P>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG38" WIDTH=65 HEIGHT=72>  If you prefer, you can keep just one sprite in each sprite file. However, you can store many sprites in a sprite file</B>:
<P><B>To</B>: </B><P><UL>
<LI><B>Open a Sprite file window</B>: Double-click on a sprite file icon, or drag its icon onto Paint's icon bar icon. Shows all sprites in the sprite file at actual size if possible. 
<LI><B>Save a <A NAME=MARKER-2-14> </A>sprite file (and all the sprites it contains)</B>: Click Menu over the Sprite file window and drag the <B>Save</B>/<B>Save as</B> icon to a directory display<A HREF="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</A>. You can save it under a different name, if you want.
<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-2-15> </A>Create a new sprite in a Sprite file window</B>: Click Menu over the Sprite file window and fill in the <B>New sprite</B>/<B>Create new sprite </B>box. You can also double-click on a blank part of the sprite file window.
<LI><B>Change the Sprite file window display</B>: Click Menu and choose one of the <B><A NAME=MARKER-2-16> </A>Display</B> options. This is rather like changing directory displays.
<LI><B>See information about Paint or the sprite file</B>: Click Menu and display the <B>Misc</B>/<B>Info</B> or <B>Misc</B>/<B>File</B> box. <B>File</B> gives you the sprite file's name, number of sprites and size in bytes.
<LI><B>See how the sprite would look if used as an icon</B>: Choose <B>Misc</B>/<B><A NAME=MARKER-2-17> </A>Use desktop colours</B>. This option is ignored if the sprite has its own <A NAME=MARKER-2-18> </A>palette.</UL>
<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-167> </A>
<H2> Manipulating sprites within a sprite file</H2>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG39" WIDTH=47 HEIGHT=92>  You can perform various operations on the sprites in a Sprite file window</B>:
<P><B>To</B>: </B><P><UL>
<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-2-8> </A>Open a sprite for editing</B>: Double-click on its picture in the Sprite file window. See <A HREF=#MARKER-9-135>page 306</A> and <A HREF=#MARKER-9-141>page 311</A> for more on editing sprites. <A NAME=MARKER-2-9> </A>You can also open other views of the same sprite (rather like the <B>New view</B> option in Draw) at different zoom settings.
<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-2-10> </A>Copy a sprite within a sprite file</B>: Click Menu over the sprite's picture in the sprite file and enter a new name in the <B>Sprite</B>/<B>Copy</B> box. You can also enter a new name in the <B>Sprite</B>/<B>Save as</B> box and drag the icon onto the Sprite file window.
<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-2-11> </A>Rename a sprite</B>: Use the <B>Sprite</B>/<B>Rename </B>box from the sprite file window menu. &nbsp;
<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-2-12> </A>Delete a sprite from a sprite file</B>: Click Menu over the sprite's picture in the sprite file window and choose <B>Sprite</B>/<B>Delete</B>. Don't delete the last sprite from a sprite file, or you won't be able to save the sprite file.
<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-2-13> </A>Save a sprite from a sprite file</B>: Click Menu over the sprite's picture in the sprite file window and drag the <B>Sprite</B>/<B>Save</B>/<B>Save as</B> icon. &nbsp;</UL>
<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-169> </A>
<H4> <A NAME=MARKER-2-106> </A>Adding an existing sprite to a sprite file</H4>
There are three ways of adding an existing sprite to a different sprite file</B>:<P>
<UL>

<LI>Drag a sprite file icon and drop it onto the destination Sprite file window. If the source sprite file contains many sprites, they're all added to the destination Sprite file window. Sprites with the same name will be overwritten.
<LI>Click Menu over a sprite's picture in the source Sprite file window and drag the <B>Sprite '<CODE>name'</CODE></B>/<B>Save</B>/<B>Save as</B> icon onto the destination Sprite file window.<P>

<LI>Click Menu over an open Sprite file window and drag the <B>Sprite</B>/<B>Save</B>/<B>Save as</B> icon onto the destination Sprite file window.<P>
</UL>
<A NAME=HEADING2-175> </A>
<H2> Handling JPEG images</H2>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG40" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=27>  You can also use Paint to edit JPEG images. To load a JPEG file into Paint, drag the <A NAME=MARKER-2-107> </A>JPEG file icon onto Paint's icon bar icon.<P>
The <A NAME=MARKER-2-108> </A>image will be converted into a sprite in the current screen mode. This means that it will be given the same number of colours as the current mode, so make sure you change to the correct mode before you load the image.<P>
If you drag a JPEG file onto Paint's icon, a Sprite file window, a sprite window and a colours window will all open, ready for you to edit the image.<P>
<B>Notes</B>:</B><P>
<UL>

<LI>Paint may automatically perform some dithering when you load a JPEG file. You can often get a better quality sprite by using <A NAME=MARKER-2-109> </A>ChangeFSI to process the JPEG file and saving the resulting sprite into Paint.<P>

<LI>Once you've loaded a JPEG file into paint, you cannot use Paint to change it back into a JPEG file. You can use ChangeFSI to do this, though - see <A HREF=E_6.HTM#MARKER-9-26><I>Output options</I> on page 346</A>.<P>

<LI>If you double-click on a JPEG file, it will be loaded automatically into <A NAME=MARKER-2-110> </A>ChangeFSI. This may not happen if your computer is low on memory. You can display a JPEG using less memory by loading it into Draw.<P>
</UL>
<A NAME=HEADING2-183> </A>
<H2> Choosing and using colours</H2>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-111> </A>You use the <A NAME=MARKER-2-112> </A>Colours window to choose the colour that you are painting with. There is a separate Colours window for each sprite. To open the Colours window (if it's not already displayed) click Menu on the sprite window and choose <B>Paint</B>/Show colours. <P>
There are in fact two different Colours windows (see <A HREF="../BOOK2B/D_3.HTM#MARKER-9-1"><I>Using colour in applications</I> on page 179</A> for details on the second of these two windows)</B>:<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG41" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=165>  <P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-186> </A>
<H3> Choosing a colour</H3>
To choose a colour, click on it in the Colours window.<P>
For sprites with up to 256 colours, the current colour is highlighted in the colours window, and shows the colour number. The colours shown are the shades that can be displayed in the current screen mode. These may be an approximation to the actual palette of the sprite (see <A HREF=#MARKER-9-125><I>Mixing new colours using a palette</I> on page 304</A>).<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-189> </A>
<H4> Finding out the colour of an individual pixel</H4>
Another way to choose a colour is to point at a <A NAME=MARKER-2-113> </A>pixel in the sprite window, click Menu and choose Paint/Select colour. You can use this method to find out exactly which colour has been used to paint the pixel.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-191> </A>
<H4> Making the Colours window smaller</H4>
You can make the Colours window smaller by clicking Menu over the sprite window and choosing <B><A NAME=MARKER-2-114> </A>Paint</B>/Small colours. This toggles the size of the sprite colours window; the colours window must be open. The small colours window takes less screen space than the large one. This is particularly valuable in 256-colour modes.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-193> </A>
<H3> <A NAME=MARKER-9-115> </A>Using a transparent mask</H3>
If a sprite with up to 256 colours has a <A NAME=MARKER-2-116> </A>mask, an extra, special colour is shown in the bottom lefthand corner of the sprite colours window as a shaded square.<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG42" WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=104>  <P>
If a 32-thousand or 16-million colour sprite has a mask, you will be able to select it by choosing <B>None</B> in the bottom of the Colours window.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-196> </A>
<H4> <B>Adding a mask</B></H4>
If a sprite doesn't have a mask, you can <A NAME=MARKER-2-117> </A>add one by clicking Menu over the sprite window and choosing <B>Edit</B>/<B>Mask</B>.<P>
For more information about using masks, see <A HREF="../BOOK2AB/E_2A.HTM#MARKER-9-90">page 295</A>.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-199> </A>
<H3> <A NAME=MARKER-9-118> </A>Applying colours using <A NAME=MARKER-2-119> </A>logical operators</H3>
There are four different ways in which you can apply colour to a sprite, using the <B>Set</B>, <B><A NAME=MARKER-2-120> </A>OR</B>, <B><A NAME=MARKER-2-121> </A>AND</B> and <B><A NAME=MARKER-2-122> </A>EOR</B> buttons in the tools window (the tools themselves are described starting on <A HREF=#MARKER-9-135>page 306</A>).<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG43" WIDTH=353 HEIGHT=99>  <P>
<B><A NAME=MARKER-2-123> </A>Set</B> causes the colour itself to be painted into the sprite. The remaining three styles cause the indicated logical operation to be applied between the colour number of the pixel on the screen and that selected in the Colours window.<P>
For example, if you choose <B>EOR</B>, spraying with colour 11 (binary 1011) onto an area that is currently colour 12 (binary 1100) will produce pixels in colour 7 (binary 0111). For a description of logical operations, see the BBC BASIC Reference Manual.<P>
<UL>

<LI><B>OR</B> sets more pixels towards the higher numbered colours in the palette. <P>

<LI><B>AND</B> sets more pixels towards the lower numbered colours in the palette. <P>

<LI><B>EOR</B> maintains a wider variety of colours than <B>OR</B> or <B>AND</B>.<P>
</UL>
You can set a sprite's palette by dropping a <A NAME=MARKER-2-124> </A>palette file onto the sprite window - see <A HREF=#MARKER-9-129>page 305</A> for more on saving palette files.<P>
The most interesting effects are achieved when spraying over a range of existing colours, or drawing overlapping filled shapes. Experiment for yourself!<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-208> </A>
<H3> <A NAME=MARKER-9-125> </A>Mixing new colours using a palette</H3>
For 32K and 16M-colour sprites, you can paint a pixel in virtually any colour by choosing it from the Colours window. However, sprites which use 256 colours or less only have a limited range of colours to choose from. In such cases, if a sprite has a palette, you can use it to mix new colours.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-210> </A>
<H4> <A NAME=MARKER-9-126> </A>Giving a sprite a palette</H4>
If a sprite doesn't have its own palette, and you want to give it one, click Menu over the sprite window and choose <B>Edit</B>/<B>Palette</B>. Sprites which don't have their own palettes use the default desktop palette for a given mode (unless <B>Display</B>/<B>Use desktop colours</B> is off, in which case the old BBC colours are used).<P>
By default, when you create a new sprite, it is given a palette.<P>
<B>Notes</B>:</B><P>
If you want to use a sprite as a tiled backdrop, it should <B>not</B> have a palette.<P>
If you intend to <A NAME=MARKER-2-127> </A>export a sprite to Draw, you should give it a palette (otherwise it won't retain the colours you give it).<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-216> </A>
<H4> Redefining colours (editing a palette)</H4>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-128> </A>This method works for all sprites with up to 16 colours, and with 256-colour sprites with true-colour<B> </B>palettes.<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>1  Click on the colour in the Colours window that you want to change.<P>
<DT><DD>2  Click Menu over the sprite window and display the <B>Paint</B>/<B>Edit palette</B>/<B>Edit colour </B>box.<P>
<DT><DD>3  Mix a new colour and click on <B>OK</B> to redefine the Colours window.<P>
</DL>
<A HREF="../Book2B/D_3.HTM#MARKER-9-1"><I>Using colour in applications</I> on page 179</A> tells you how to mix colours. The colour displayed is the best approximation available in the current screen mode to the shade you select. The exact colour is recorded by Paint; it is displayed more accurately if you change to a mode with more colours.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-222> </A>
<H4> 256-colour sprites with colour palettes</H4>
The one exception when mixing new colours is a 256-colour sprite with a <B>colour</B> palette (as opposed to a true-colour palette). In order to be able to edit such a sprite's palette, you need to save its palette back into the sprite window (see below). Alternatively, you can create a 256-greyscale sprite and edit its palette.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-224> </A>
<H4> <A NAME=MARKER-9-129> </A>Saving a palette</H4>
To <A NAME=MARKER-9-130> </A>save a sprite's palette</B>:<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>1  Click Menu over the sprite window and display the Save/Palette box</B>:<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG44" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=79>  <P>
<DT><DD>2  Drag the Save as icon to a directory display.<P>
</DL>
If you want to use the same palette in another sprite, drag this palette file onto the new sprite window. This modifies the palette used by the sprite.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-229> </A>
<H3>Creating an extended colour fill (ECF)</H3>
<B>Note</B></B>: ECFs are only really provided for backwards compatibility. We don't recommend that you use them.<P>
To create an ECF, click Menu over the sprite window and choose <B>Paint</B>/Select ECF. This leads to a dialogue box which you can use to extract the bottom lefthand pixels of a named sprite as an <A NAME=MARKER-2-131> </A>ECF pattern. ECFs are patterns that you can use in place of a colour, and are added to the sprite palette, below the plain colours.<P>
You can't define an ECF for sprites with more than 256 colours. You can define up to four ECFs for each sprite.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-233> </A>
<H2> <A NAME=MARKER-9-132> </A>Zooming in and out (scaling a sprite window)</H2>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG45" WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=75>  To scale the size of a sprite window to make it easier to edit, press Menu over the sprite window and set a <B><A NAME=MARKER-2-133> </A></B>zoom factor in the <B>Zoom</B>/<B>Magnifier</B> dialogue box</B>:<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG46" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=50>  <P>
The magnification only changes the size at which the sprite is displayed in the window; the actual definition, height and width are not affected. The magnification is expressed as a ratio; for example 2</B>:1 means twice normal size, 3</B>:4 means three-quarters of normal size, and so on. You can change the ratio either by clicking on the up and down arrows, or by typing in a new value at the caret.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-236> </A>
<H2> Using a grid</H2>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG47" WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=75>  You can use a <A NAME=MARKER-2-134> </A>grid to see the boundaries between individual pixels in a sprite</B>:
<P><B>To</B>: </B><P><UL>
<LI><B>Toggle the grid on or off</B>: Press Menu over the sprite window and choose <B>Grid</B>.
<LI><B>Change the grid's display colour</B>: Press Menu over the sprite window and choose a colour from the <B>Grid</B> submenu.</UL>
<P>
The grid is displayed at different magnifications for sprites of different sizes (so for example, you might only see the grid at zooms of 3</B>:1 or higher for one sprite, but at zooms of 5</B>:1 or higher for another). <P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-239> </A>
<H2> <A NAME=MARKER-9-135> </A>Using Paint's tools</H2>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-136> </A>You choose tools from the Paint tools window to edit a sprite (or JPEG file).<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG48" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=118>  <P>

<A NAME=MARKER-2-140> </A><P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG67" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=27>   Here's a bit more on using a sprite as a brush (there are a couple of examples of using this tool in the <A HREF="../BOOK2AB/E_2A.HTM#HEADING2-121">Paint tutorial</A>:
<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG68" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=163>  
<P><B>To</B>: </B><P><UL>
<LI><B>Use one of the default brush shapes</B>: Type one of the default names into the <B>Name</B> box and click on <B>OK</B>. You can use <CODE>square</CODE>, <CODE>triangle</CODE>, <CODE>circle</CODE> or <CODE>brush</CODE>.
<LI><B>Use one of your own sprites as a brush</B>: Open the Sprite file window and type the sprite's name in the <B>Name</B> box and click on <B>OK</B>. &nbsp;
<LI><B>Use just the outline of the source sprite</B>: Switch <B>Shape</B> on and click on <B>OK</B>. Pixels in brush sprite which are not transparent are set to the current colour.
<LI><B>Paint with the full coloured sprite image</B>: Switch <B>Shape</B> off and click on <B>OK</B>. &nbsp;
<LI><B>Use the source sprite at a different size</B>: Set the X scale and Y scale multipliers and click on <B>OK</B>. This is useful for using the same source sprite at different sizes.</UL>
<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-256> </A>
<H2> <A NAME=MARKER-9-141> </A>Changing a sprite's size, shape and orientation</H2>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG69" WIDTH=68 HEIGHT=163>  You can perform many operations on a <A NAME=MARKER-2-142> </A>sprite using Paint's Edit menu (click Menu over a sprite window and choose from the <B>Paint</B>/<B>Edit</B> submenu)</B>:
<P>
<B>Function and option to choose:</B><P><UL>
<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-2-19> </A>Invert a sprite vertically about its centre</B>: <A NAME=MARKER-2-20> </A>Flip vertically
<LI><B>Invert a sprite horizontally about its centre</B>: Flip horizontally
<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-2-21> </A>Rotate a sprite about its centre</B>: Rotate<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG70" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=27>  Enter the angle in the Rotation box.<P>The sprite size changes if you rotate for angles other than multiples of 90 degrees (unless the sprite has an even aspect ratio and pixel height/width).
<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-2-22> </A>Scale the sprite horizontally or vertically</B>: <A NAME=MARKER-2-23> </A>Scale x or Scale y<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG71" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=27>  Enter the scale factor in the Factor box. Negative scale factors are not allowed.
<LI><B>Slant the sprite horizontally</B>: <A NAME=MARKER-2-24> </A>Shear<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG72" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=27>  Enter the shear factor in the Shear box.<P>The top row of pixels is moved right. The rows in between are moved proportionally. The factor is the tangent of the angle you want to shear by. A factor of 1 slants the sprite 45 degrees.
<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-2-25> </A>Add or delete rows or columns from the top or right edge of a sprite</B>: <A NAME=MARKER-2-26> </A>Adjust size <P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG73" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=71>  Use the arrows in the Sprite size box, or fill in the <B>Width</B> and <B>Height</B> boxes, and click on <B>OK</B>.
<LI><B>Add or delete columns at the pointer position</B>: <A NAME=MARKER-2-27> </A>Insert columns, Insert rows, Delete columns, Delete rows</B><P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG74" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=27>  Inserted rows or columns are filled with colour 0.<P>Columns are deleted to the right of the pixel over which you clicked Menu. Rows are deleted upwards. <P>See below for more information.</UL>
<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-258> </A>
<H4> More on adding and deleting rows and columns</H4>
Enter the number of rows or columns in the <B>How many?</B> box and click Select or press Return. Alternatively, without passing over a menu, move the pointer over the sprite window to change the size of the highlighted area that appears and click when the <B>How many?</B> box shows the right number.<P>
Deleting the column of pixels on the righthand edge of a sprite can be difficult. Increasing the zoom scale can help, or you can delete the last column separately by using <B>Adjust size</B> to decrease the width by 1 column.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-261> </A>
<H2> <A NAME=MARKER-9-143> </A>Taking screen snapshots</H2>
You can use Paint to save part of the screen as a sprite file (this is how the pictures of menus, windows and so on were produced in this User Guide).<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG75" WIDTH=59 HEIGHT=44>  Start <A NAME=MARKER-2-144> </A>snapshot by choosing <B>Snapshot</B> from the icon bar menu. This displays the snapshot dialogue box</B>:<IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG76" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=99>  
<P>
<B>Function/Procedure:</B><P><UL>
<LI><B>Take a snapshot of the whole screen</B>: Tick the <B>Grab whole screen</B> box and click on <B>OK</B>. Drag the resulting <B>Save as </B>icon to a directory display.
<LI><B>Take a snapshot of part of the screen</B>: <P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG77" WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=25>  Switch <B>Grab whole screen</B> <B>off</B> and click on <B>OK</B>. Then drag a select box (using the camera pointer that appears) round the area you want to snapshot. Drag the resulting <B>Save as </B>icon to a directory display.
<LI><B>Set a delay before the snapshot is taken</B>: Switch on <B>User defined</B> in the Delay before snapshot area and enter the delay in seconds. Then take the snapshot as above. This allows you to take shots of transient items (like menus)</B>: while the timer is counting down, you can position menus etc. in the snapshot area you defined.</UL>
<P>
<A NAME=HEADING2-264> </A>
<H2> Printing a sprite</H2>
Before you can <A NAME=MARKER-2-145> </A>print a sprite, you must have the Printer manager loaded. There are two ways you can print a sprite</B>:<P>
<UL>

<LI>Click Menu over the sprite's picture in the Sprite file window and display the <B>Sprite</B>/<B>Print</B>/<B>Print sprite</B> dialogue box.<P>

<LI>Click Menu over the sprite window and display the <B>Misc</B>/<B>Print</B>/<B>Print sprite</B> dialogue box.<P>
</UL>
The dialogue box is the same in both cases. The exact contents of the dialogue box depend on the printer driver in use, but it typically allows you to choose the orientation (<B>Portrait</B> or <B>Landscape</B>) scaling, and position on the paper. <P><IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG78" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=140>  <P>
<B>Scale</B> allows you to change the proportions of the printed image. Setting both x and y to 1</B>:2 will produce a half-sized image.<P>
<B>Corner</B> defines where on the printed page the image will be printed. The default settings define the edge of the printable page for your printer. Changing these settings will move the printing position of the image.<P>

<H2> Saving Paint features in a Desktop boot file</H2>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/E2IMAG79" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=33>  You <A NAME=MARKER-2-146> </A>may want to change some aspects of the way new Paint windows appear when you first open them. For example, a new window normally opens with Zoom magnification set to 1</B>:1, but you may prefer to have the Zoom option set to 2</B>:1 each time you start Paint.<P>
You can set features of this type by setting up Paint as you want to use it, then save these features by creating a <A NAME=MARKER-2-147> </A>Desktop boot file. Instructions on how to create a Desktop boot file are given in <A HREF="../Book3b/BOOK3_6.HT#HEADING6-0"><I>Configuring applications</I> on page 427</A><I>.</I><P>
There are several features of Paint that you can set before saving a Desktop boot file, so that they are set up the way you want them each time you switch on. <P>

<P>
<B>Note</B></B>: If you create a sprite file on your computer containing a sprite with no mode number, be careful if you use it with an older Acorn computer running RISC OS 3.10 or earlier, as switching to the brush tool in Paint on RISC OS 3.10 or earlier whilst editing the sprite file will cause Paint to crash. <P>
This sort of file is easy to identify, as at least one of the sprites will fail to show in the sprite file window on those versions of Paint.<P>
You can find out if your sprite file has a such a sprite by displaying the sprite file window using the <B>Full info</B> menu option.<P>
