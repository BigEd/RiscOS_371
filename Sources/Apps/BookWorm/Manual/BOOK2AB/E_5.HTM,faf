This application lets you play ordinary audio <A NAME=MARKER-2-2> </A>CDs using a CD-ROM drive on your computer. It allows you to control playback using the same basic controls as you would find on a CD player. It also has a comprehensive programming facility. It's only useful if your computer has a CD-ROM drive fitted (and configured). It is not supplied on all machines.<P>

<H4> Notes on playing programs</H4>
When CDPlayer is set to play a program, the following restrictions apply</B>:<P>
<UL>

<LI>You can't drag or click on the slider and slider bar.<P>

<LI>The time display will only show the time the disc has been playing.<P>

<LI>The main CD Player window must be open to allow the programmed tracks to be played.<P>
</UL>
When playing a mixed mode CD (mixed audio and data tracks), using the <B>ALL</B> button guarantees that all the audio tracks will be played, otherwise the drive will normally stop when it encounters a data track, even if there are subsequent audio tracks.<A NAME=MARKER-2-15> </A><P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-41> </A>
<H2> <A NAME=MARKER-2-16> </A>Setup window</H2>
Each CDPlayer can be used to control a single CD-ROM drive at one time, which is selected using the <B>Setup</B> window. CDPlayer is supplied already set up to use an IDE CD-ROM drive. You'll only need to change the Setup if you wish to use a drive of a different type (e.g. SCSI).<P>
To open the Setup window, choose <B>Setup</B> from CDPlayer's icon bar menu</B>:<P><IMG SRC="PICS3/E5IMA117" WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=73>  <P>
Click on the <B>+</B> and <B>-</B> icons until the correct device, unit and card numbers are shown for the CD-ROM drive you wish to use. If you're not sure what the numbers should be for a particular drive, you can find them out by typing at the command line</B>:<P>
<CODE>*CDDevices (and press Return)</CODE>    <I>(see the file <CODE>Tutorials.StarComms).</CODE></I><P>
It is not advisable to keep switching CDPlayer from one drive to another using the Setup window. This operation should only be performed when CDPlayer is first started. If you need to control more than one drive, you should start the CDPlayer application as many times as you require and change each copy's setup individually before use.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-47> </A>
<H2> <A NAME=MARKER-9-17> </A>Quitting CDPlayer</H2>
To <A NAME=MARKER-2-18> </A>quit the CDPlayer application, choose <B>Quit</B> from its icon bar menu.<A NAME=MARKER-2-19> </A><P>
