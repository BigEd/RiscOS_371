<H2> Starting Alarm</H2>
Alarm is in the Apps icon bar directory display. To start the application, double-click on the !Alarm application icon. The clock icon appears on the icon bar showing the time.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING3-12> </A>
<H2> Setting the time</H2>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/E3IMAG83" WIDTH=55 HEIGHT=64>  Use the <B>Set clock</B> dialogue box to set the clock's <A NAME=MARKER-2-8> </A>time and date. The new time and date applies to the entire RISC OS system, not just to Alarm. You only need to set the time the very first time you use the system. The time should then remain set correctly.<P>
If you are setting the time during the summer months you should check to see if your country is running daylight saving time. If it is you should click on the <B><A NAME=MARKER-2-9> </A>BST</B> option before setting the time. <P>
To display the<B> <A NAME=MARKER-2-10> </A>Set clock</B> dialogue box, click Menu over the Alarm icon on the icon bar and choose <B>Set clock</B>.<P>
To change the time and date</B>:<P><IMG SRC="PICS3/E3IMAG84" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=59>  <P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>1  Click on the appropriate arrows in the <B>Set clock</B> dialogue box. Click on <B>BST</B> if British Summer Time is in operation.<P>
<DT><DD>2  Click on <B>Set</B> to set the clock to the new time.<P>
</DL>
<A NAME=HEADING3-19> </A>
<H2> Setting an alarm</H2>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/E3IMAG85" WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=47>  This section shows you how to set an alarm using the <B>Set alarm</B> dialogue box. To display the Set alarm dialogue box, click on the time display icon on the icon bar.<P><IMG SRC="PICS3/E3IMAG86" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=128>  <P>
This is the dialogue box used to set the alarm date and time; you can also type in some text which will be displayed as a message on screen when the alarm goes off.<P>
To set an alarm</B>:<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>1  Adjust the time by clicking on the arrows either side of the time box. The arrows on the lefthand side adjust the hours, those on the right the minutes. <P>
<DT><DD>2  If you want to change the date, alter the date, month and (if necessary) year boxes.<P>
<DT><DD>3  In the <B>Message</B> box, type the text that you want to display when the alarm goes off.<P>
<DT><DD>4  Click on Save to save the alarm settings and set the alarm.<P>
</DL>
When an alarm is set, the box surrounding the time display on the icon bar changes <A NAME=MARKER-2-13> </A>colour.<P>
The following options are also on the Set alarm window</B>:<P>
<A NAME=HEADING3-29> </A>
<H4> <A NAME=MARKER-2-14> </A>Urgent</H4>
You can mark an alarm as urgent by clicking on the Urgent box. It will then sound an <A NAME=MARKER-2-15> </A>audible alarm when it goes off, even if you have selected the Silent option from the setup dialogue box menu (see <A HREF=#MARKER-9-23><I>Configuring the Alarm setup options</I> on page 321</A>). <P>
<A NAME=HEADING3-31> </A>
<H4> Task alarm</H4>
Instead <A NAME=MARKER-2-17> </A>of merely giving you a message when an alarm goes off, Alarm can carry out a task. A task can be anything you can do on the Desktop or command line</B>: running a program or loading an application, for example. Click on the Task alarm box and enter the command you want carried out in the message boxes. You can also set up a Task alarm by dragging a file onto the Set alarm window. If you drag an application onto the window, for example, that application will run at the time set for the alarm. If you drag a text file, the text will be displayed in an Edit application window; you might use this option to display, at the start of the day, a list of things you have to do.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING3-33> </A>
<H4> <A NAME=MARKER-2-18> </A>Working week</H4>
This limits the alarm settings for any repeating alarms to be within the specified working week; the working week is defined in the Alarm Setup window, and is Monday to Friday by default. This option only takes effect if the Repeating alarm option is also selected.<P>
If you have set an alarm that falls outside the working week it will always go off on the last working day before the appointment. This is to prevent you missing an appointment that is scheduled outside the working week.<P>
Any changes to the working week affect all Alarms, including those already set and saved.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING3-37> </A>
<H4> Repeating alarm</H4>
You can set an alarm to go off more than once by switching the <B>Repeating alarm</B> option on</B>:<P><IMG SRC="PICS3/E3IMAG87" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=202>  <P>
Choose whether you want the alarm to repeat at a set time (for example, every 19 days) or on a set day (for example, every second Monday of every second month).<P>
Alter the repeat interval by clicking on the arrow boxes, and by selecting the unit in which the interval is measured from the buttons shown. To limit just the current alarm to the working week, click on the <B>Working week</B> box. To limit <B>all</B> your alarms to the working week by default, choose the Repeating alarms option in the setup dialogue box. <P>
You can set more than one alarm by simply repeating the Set alarm procedure.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING3-42> </A>
<H2> When an alarm goes off</H2>
When the <A NAME=MARKER-2-20> </A>alarm time is reached, a window similar to the one below appears on the screen.<P><IMG SRC="PICS3/E3IMAG88" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=79>  <P>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/E3IMAG89" WIDTH=62 HEIGHT=43>  If it is not a repeating alarm, cancel the alarm and remove the window by clicking on its Close icon. Alternatively, click Menu on the window and choose Accept alarm. If you wish to defer the alarm (like using a 'Sleep' button on an ordinary bedside alarm clock) choose <A NAME=MARKER-2-21> </A>Defer alarm, and select the time interval by which you want to delay the alarm. This then leads to a menu into which you can enter the number of minutes, hours, etc. If your alarm repeats every so many minutes or hours, it will be deferred from the current time. If its repeat unit is longer, it will be deferred from the alarm time.<P>
When a repeating alarm goes off, click Menu on the alarm window. Choose Accept alarm to stop the alarm and remove the window, leaving the alarm set for next time, or choose Cancel alarm to stop it going off again.<P>
If Alarm is not running when the alarm is due to go off, the alarm will be triggered next time Alarm is started. If the alarm is a repeating alarm, you will receive a message for the first repeat due for the period when Alarm was not running, but not for subsequent <A NAME=MARKER-2-22> </A>ones.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING3-47> </A>

<A NAME=HEADING3-60> </A>
<H4> <A NAME=MARKER-2-27> </A>Alarms are silent unless urgent</H4>
When this is selected, only <A NAME=MARKER-2-28> </A>urgent alarms sound an audible beep at alarm time. When it is not selected, all alarms sound an audible beep.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING3-62> </A>
<H4> <A NAME=MARKER-2-29> </A>Repeating alarms fit into a working week</H4>
When this is selected, any subsequent repeating alarms you set, or alarms that you defer, will skip those days you have not selected. An alarm repeating monthly or annually will go off on the working day before its due date.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING3-64> </A>
<H4> Continuous <A NAME=MARKER-2-30> </A>beep</H4>
Click on this box if you want an audible alarm to sound continuously until you cancel the alarm.<P>

<A NAME=MARKER-2-32> </A>This option lets Alarm automatically update the alarm database file whenever you set or change an alarm. If you choose this option then each time Alarm starts it automatically remembers any alarms that have been stored. (If your hard disc is locked, you'll see an error box.)<P>
<A NAME=HEADING3-70> </A>
<H4> Confirm alarm deletions</H4>
When this option is selected, you are prompted for confirmation each time an existing alarm is <A NAME=MARKER-2-33> </A>deleted.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING3-72> </A>
<H4> Display format</H4>
This section allows you to choose how you wish the alarm clock to be displayed on the icon bar. The formats available are</B>:<P>

For information on how to set up your own formats, see <A HREF=#MARKER-9-52><I>Time and date display formats</I> on page 327</A>. The format and other features you select for Alarm will be saved in any Desktop boot file you create (providing Alarm is running when you save the file). These options are listed at the end of this chapter. For information on how to create a Desktop boot file, refer to <A HREF="../BOOKB/BOOK_5.HTM#HEADING5-0"><I>Customising the desktop start-up procedure</I> on page 51</A><I>.</I><P>
