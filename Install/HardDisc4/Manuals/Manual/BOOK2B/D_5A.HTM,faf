The drawing above shows a six mile walk through the countryside,
and is divided into four parts</B>: 
<UL>

<LI>A map showing the route of the walk and how to get to the
starting point. 

<LI>A written description of the walk. 

<LI>A photographic view of part of the walk. 

<LI>An information box describing how many miles long the walk
is, how long it takes to complete, the going (wet) and any points
of interest. 
</UL>
<P>
The following pages will take you step-by-step through the process
of creating the above drawing, showing you how to draw a map compass,
lake, roads, road scale, woods and rivers. You'll also learn how
to drag text files (created by Edit) and sprites (created by Paint)
into a Draw window. 
<H3><A NAME="HEADING5_45">Undoing your mistakes </A></H3>
<P>
If you do something by mistake while you're working through this
tutorial, try pressing F8. This is a keyboard short-cut for the
<B>Misc</B>/<A NAME="MARKER-2-107"><B>Undo</B> option, and should
undo your last operation. If you decide that you didn't want to
undo something after all, just press F9 (</A><A NAME="MARKER-2-108"><B>Redo</B>).</A>
<H3><A NAME="HEADING5_47">Selecting Draw objects </A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="MARKER-2-109">Before you start on the map, it's worth
spending a short time practising how to select objects. This is
important</B>: before you can do anything to a Draw object - move
it, for instance, or change its colour - you need to select it.
</A>
<P>
A Draw picture will typically contain lots of objects overlapping
each other, and often one object will be completely behind another.
Selecting just the object you want to alter needs a bit of skill.
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>1 Open the<CODE> Tutorials.DrawTutor </CODE>directory and
double-click on the file called <CODE>Sign</CODE>. Once this file
is loaded it looks like this</B>: 
<IMG SRC="PICS1/D5IMAG28" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=82>  
</DL>
<P>
This drawing consists of three objects</B>: 
<UL>

<LI>the outside circle - this is at the front (i.e. on top) of
the three objects 

<LI>the triangle 

<LI>the exclamation mark - at the back of the stack of three objects.

</UL>
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>2 <IMG SRC="PICS1/D5IMAG29" WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=24> Choose the Select tool from
the toolbox (if it's not already highlighted).  
</DL>
<P>
The toolbox is the strip of icons down the lefthand side of the
Draw window - click on the arrow at the bottom of the toolbox
and it will be highlighted.
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>3 Click on the circle to select it. A dotted box (known as
a <A NAME="MARKER-2-111">bounding box) will appear around it,
indicating that it is selected</B>: 
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG30" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=88>  
</A>
</DL>
<H4><A NAME="MARKER-2-112">Selecting 'buried' objects </A></H4>
<P>
When an object's bounding box extends beyond others, it's easy
to select</B>: as long as you click on that part of the object, it
will be selected. When an object is in front of others (as the
circle is), again you'll have no problem</B>: click anywhere within
it to select it. 
<P>
However, it can be difficult to select an object that's 'underneath'
other objects. You can often see many objects apparently occupying
the same physical place, but in fact they're '<A NAME="MARKER-2-113">stacked'
on top of one another.</A>
<P>
For instance, clicking on the triangle will in fact select the
circle, because the circle is in front of the triangle. To select
the triangle, you need to <A NAME="MARKER-2-114"><B>double-click</B>
on it.</A>
<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG31" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=84> 
<P>
If you double-click many times, you'll 'tunnel down' through the
objects that are stacked on top of each other, selecting each
one in turn.
<H4><A NAME="HEADING5_63">Changing the '</A><A NAME="MARKER-2-115">stacking
order' of overlapping objects </A></H4>
<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG32" WIDTH=79 HEIGHT=173> The exclamation mark is behind
the triangle, so you <B>could</B> select it by double-clicking
and tunnelling down through the stack of objects to reach it.
However, another way of getting to a buried object is to send
the objects covering it to the <A NAME="MARKER-2-116">back of
the stack</B>:</A>
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>1 Select the circle, press Menu and choose <B>Select</B>/<A NAME="MARKER-2-117"><B>Back</B>
(or press Ctrl-B). 
</A>
<DT>
<DD>2 Select the triangle (by double-clicking) press Menu and
choose <B>Select</B>/<B>Back. 
</B>
<DT>
<DD>3 Select the exclamation mark by single-clicking on it. 
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG33" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=83>  
</DL>
<P>
Now the exclamation mark is always at the front; you don't need
to double-click repeatedly each time you want to select it.
<P>
You can change the stacking order of objects using this method
(e.g. you could bring the circle to the front of the stack by
selecting it and choosing <B>Select</B>/<A NAME="MARKER-2-118"><B>Front</B>).</A>
<H4><A NAME="HEADING5_70">Moving selected objects </A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="MARKER-2-119">Once you've selected an object, you can
drag it anywhere within the Draw window. For example</B>:</A>
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>1 Select the exclamation mark and move the pointer inside
the bounding box.  
<DT>
<DD>2 Now hold down Select and drag the exclamation mark outside
the circle (don't click on the 'handles', these stretch and rotate
the object)</B>: 
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG34" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=80>  
</DL>
<P>
Having practised selecting objects, there is nothing else you
need to do with this file, so you can close it by clicking on
its Close icon. If during your experimenting, you have changed
the file at all, you'll see a message warning you of this; click
on <B>Discard</B> to tell the computer you don't want to save
your changes.
<H3><A NAME="MARKER-9-120">Start the drawing</B>: create the map symbols
</A></H3>
<P>
Six different symbols are used on the map; two types of tree,
a picnic site, a mountain, an historic building and a parking
site symbol</B>:
<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG35" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=35> 
<P>
The first part of this tutorial takes you through creating these
symbols.
<H4><A NAME="HEADING5_78">Set the size of the drawing area </A>
</H4>
<P>
The first step in creating the map is to click on the Draw icon
on the icon bar (if you don't have Draw loaded on the icon bar
see <A HREF="D_5.HTM#MARKER-9-65">page 193</A>). This displays an empty
<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG36" WIDTH=58 HEIGHT=130> Draw window. You should now check
that the <A NAME="MARKER-2-121">drawing area is A4, </A><A NAME="MARKER-2-122">landscape</B>:
</A>
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>1 Move your pointer into the Draw window and press Menu. 

<DT>
<DD>2 Make sure both <B>Landscape</B> and <B>A4</B> are ticked
in the <B>Misc</B>/<A NAME="MARKER-2-123"><B>Paper limits</B>
menu.  
</A>
</DL>
<H4><A NAME="HEADING5_82">Make the Draw window larger </A></H4>
<P>
The Draw window that is displayed is quite small. Increase the
size of this window</B>:
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>1 Make sure that the zoom is 1</B>:1 (press Menu and check the
<B>Zoom</B> option). 
<DT>
<DD>2 Drag the window to the top left of your screen. 
<DT>
<DD>3 <IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG37" WIDTH=22 HEIGHT=20> Drag the Adjust size icon
down and to the right so the window is larger, and looks nearly
square. 
</DL>
<H4><A NAME="HEADING5_87">Switch on Draw's grid </A></H4>
<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG38" WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=136> To superimpose a <A NAME="MARKER-2-125">grid
within the window</B>:</A>
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>1 Press Menu on the Draw window. 
<DT>
<DD>2 Choose <A NAME="MARKER-2-126"><B>Grid</B>/</A><A NAME="MARKER-2-127"><B>Show</B>
by clicking with Adjust. 
</A>
<DT>
<DD>3 Choose <B>Grid</B>/<A NAME="MARKER-2-128"><B>Lock</B> (this
time click Select and the menu will disappear)</B>: 
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG39" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=174>  
</A>
</DL>
<P>
The easiest way to create most of the map symbols is to draw them
large and then shrink them down to the size you want. When you
have finished creating all the map symbols your Draw window will
look something like this</B>:
<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG40" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=230> 
<H4><A NAME="HEADING5_93"><IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG41" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=27> Create
the hall symbol </A></H4>
<P>
There are five steps involved in creating the hall symbol</B>:
<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG42" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=69> 
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>1 <IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG43" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=27> Choose the <A NAME="MARKER-2-129">Rectangle
tool from the toolbox, then move the pointer over one of the grid
markers near the top lefthand corner and click. This marks one
corner of the rectangle. Move the pointer down two grid units
and right three grid units and click again. The rectangle will
be displayed, locked to the grid. 
</A>
<DT>
<DD>2 <IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG44" WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=21> Now choose the <A NAME="MARKER-2-130">Straight
line tool. Create two vertical lines within the rectangle. (To
draw a single line, click once at the start point of the line,
move the pointer, then double-click at the end point of the line.)

</A>
<DT>
<DD>3 Now draw a two-<A NAME="MARKER-2-131">segment line for the
roof</B>: Move to the top left of the rectangle and click once. Move
right one and a half grid units and up one grid unit and click
again. Finally move to the top right of the rectangle and double-click.

</A>
<DT>
<DD>4 Next, to make the rectangle and all the lines in the symbol
into one object, you have to select them all and then <A NAME="MARKER-2-132">group
them</B>: 
</A>
</DL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG45" WIDTH=71 HEIGHT=172> <IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG46" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=27>
Choose the Select tool at the bottom of the toolbox. Select all
the objects in the hall symbol (by dragging a <I>select box</I>
around them), press Menu and <A NAME="MARKER-2-133">choose <B>Select</B>/<B>Group</B></B>:</A>
<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG47" WIDTH=333 HEIGHT=150> 
<P>
If you now click outside the new bounding box, it will disappear.
To select the symbol again just click on it.
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>5 Finally, thicken the lines in the symbol to make it stand
out more</B>: Select the hall symbol, press Menu and choose <B>4</B>
from the <B>Style</B>/<B>Line width</B> menu. All the lines in
the symbol will be redrawn 4 points wide (a point is 1/72 inch).

</DL>
<H4><A NAME="HEADING5_102"><IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG48" WIDTH=53 HEIGHT=40> Create
the conifer tree symbol</A></H4>
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>1 Choose the Straight line tool in the toolbox. 
<DT>
<DD>2 Move to the right of the hall symbol and draw a vertical
line four grid units high (notice that the lines you draw now
are very thick).  
<DT>
<DD>3 Move to the left of the line and create a two-line segment
to act as the top two branches of the tree (do this in the same
way you created the roof of the hall symbol).  
<DT>
<DD>4 Now move down and create two more sets of branches. 
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG49" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=128>  
<DT>
<DD>5 <IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG50" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=24> When you've finished the
tree choose the <A NAME="MARKER-2-136">Select tool, drag a </A><A NAME="MARKER-2-137">select
box around the tree and group it into one object. 
</A>
</DL>
<H4><A NAME="HEADING5_108"><IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG51" WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=37> Create
the picnic site symbol </A></H4>
<P>
The picnic site symbol is much easier to create than it looks</B>:
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>1 Select the tree symbol you have just created, press Menu
and choose <B>Select</B>/<B>Copy</B>. A <A NAME="MARKER-2-138">copy
of the tree will appear slightly below and to the right of the
original. Drag this copy several grid markers to the right of
the original tree. 
</A>
<DT>
<DD>2 Choose the Straight line tool and add three lines to the
copy of the tree to make up the remainder of the picnic site symbol.

<DT>
<DD>3 Once again make the symbol into a single object by grouping
it. 
</DL>
<H4><A NAME="HEADING5_113"><IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG52" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=25> Create
the mountain symbol </A></H4>
<P>
The mountain symbol is just a solid triangle and is very simple
to create.
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>1 <IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG53" WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=21> Choose the <A NAME="MARKER-2-139">Joined
line tool.  
</A>
</DL>
<P>
This tool allows you to create straight lines with the added feature
that, when you double-click to end your path, an extra line is
drawn to join the last point to the first point.
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>2 Move to the right of the picnic site symbol and draw a triangle
as shown below. (The third line is drawn automatically when you
double-click on the last point. 
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG54" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=76> ) 
<DT>
<DD>3 Now colour the inside of the triangle black</B>: Choose the
Select tool and Select the triangle, press Menu and go into <A NAME="MARKER-2-140">the
</A><A NAME="MARKER-2-141"><B>Style</B>/<B>Fill colour</B> box.
Click on the black patch near the bottom right of the Fill colour
box and click on <B>OK</B></B>: 
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG55" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=144>  
</A>
</DL>
<H4><A NAME="HEADING5_119">How style options work </A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="MARKER-2-142">Before you draw your next symbol it is
important that you understand how the </A><A NAME="MARKER-2-143">Style
menu works. Every time you choose a style, e.g. Fill colour, it
stays in force until you change it again, <B>and</B> it affects
other tools. So if you set Fill colour to black, any subsequent
rectangles, lines and curves you draw will also be filled in black.
To avoid drawing an object in the wrong style, each time you choose
a new tool check that you have the correct fill colour, line width
etc. <B>before</B> you draw the new object.</A>
<H4><A NAME="HEADING5_121"><IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG56" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=37> Create
the deciduous tree symbol </A></H4>
<P>
The deciduous tree symbol requires a little more time and 'artistry'
to create. Draw this symbol below the other symbols. All your
symbols will then be in full view without the need to scroll.
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>1 <IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG57" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=22> Choose the Straight line
tool. Move the pointer near to the bottom right of the window
and draw a small vertical line. 
<DT>
<DD>2 Turn off the <B>Grid</B>/<B>Show</B> and <B>Grid</B>/<B>Lock</B>
options (it's very difficult to draw curves with the grid switched
on).  
<DT>
<DD>3 <IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG58" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=21> Choose the <A NAME="MARKER-2-144">Curved
line tool. 
</A>
<DT>
<DD>4 Choose <B>None</B> in the <B>Style</B>/<B>Fill colour</B>
box, then click on <B>OK</B>. This will ensure that whatever you
draw next will <B>not</B> be filled in. 
<DT>
<DD>5 Move the pointer to the top of the small vertical line and
click. Now move very slightly down and to the left.  
</DL>
<P>
You'll notice that there is a small blue square over the point
where you first clicked Select, and as you move the pointer a
small orange square will also appear. The blue squares are simply
to show you where you clicked Select as you build up a curve.
The orange squares are <A NAME="MARKER-2-145"><I>control points</I>;
they help to show you how the curve is being generated (there's
more on this in </A><A HREF="D_5.HTM#MARKER-9-219"><I>Editing curves</I> on page 243</A>).
Both types of square will disappear when you finish your curve.
For the time being, just build up your curve clicking Select at
roughly the points shown below</B>:
<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG59" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=116> 
<P>
When you come to the end of the curve double-click (and leave
your pointer where it is). Don't worry if your curve isn't exactly
the same as the one above. 
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>6 Now you can create the other two curves in the same way.
By starting the next curve where you finished the previous one
you will create a smoother, more continuous effect to the outline
of the tree. 
</DL>
<P>
If you are dissatisfied with your curves you can either delete
them and start again, or edit them. You can delete a curve (or
any object) by selecting it and choosing <B>Select</B>/<B>Delete</B>.
If you want to learn how to edit curves see <A HREF="D_5.HTM#MARKER-9-219">page 243</A>.
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>7 Finally, make the symbol into a single object by grouping
it. 
</DL>
<H4><A NAME="HEADING5_133">Create the parking symbol </A></H4>
<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG60" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=31> There are five steps involved in
creating the car parking symbol</B>:
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>1 <IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG61" WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=24> Turn on the <B>Grid</B>/<B>Show</B>
option (but leave the <B>Grid</B>/<B>Lock</B> option off). Then
choose the Rectangle tool and set the <B>Style</B>/<B>Line width</B>
to <A NAME="MARKER-2-146"><B>Thin</B>.  
</A>
<DT>
<DD>2 Now move to the left of the deciduous tree symbol. Click
and drag the pointer to make a small rectangle, about half a grid
unit wide, and almost one grid unit tall. 
<DT>
<DD>3 <IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG62" WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=24> Choose the Select tool and
select the rectangle. Then press Menu and go into the <B>Style</B>/<B>Fill
colour</B> box. Click on the black patch near the bottom right
of the box and click on <B>OK</B>. 
<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG63" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=85>  
<DT>
<DD>4 <IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG64" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=27> Choose the <A NAME="MARKER-2-147">Text
tool. Position the pointer near the rectangle you've just drawn
and click. A red vertical bar (known as a 'caret') will appear.
Type the letter <CODE>P</CODE>. 
</A>
<DT>
<DD>5 <IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG65" WIDTH=22 HEIGHT=24> Use the Select tool to select
the <CODE>P</CODE>. <A NAME="MARKER-2-148">Now go into the <B>Style</B>/<B>Font

<IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG66" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=98>  
</A>
</DL>
<P>
<B>Note</B></B>: <IMG SRC="PICS3/D5IMAG67" WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=21> Never leave text colour

</DL>
<H4><A NAME="MARKER-2-152">Scale the map symbols </A></H4>
<P>
Now reduce the size of the first five symbols to the correct size

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>1 Begin by selecting the hall and mountain symbols (by clicking
Adjust on each symbol). Press Menu and copy them using <B>Select</B>/<B>Copy</B>.

<DT>
<DD>2 Now drag the two selected copies down towards the bottom
lefthand corner.  
</DL>
<P>
Notice that both selected objects move as you drag one of them.
Deselect them, drag each one separately into the bottom lefthand
corner, then select them both again.
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>3 Press Menu and move to the <B>Transform</B>/<A NAME="MARKER-2-153"><B>Magnify</B>

<P>
The compass is made up of four quadrants, but you only need to
create one.

<DT>
<DD>2 Choose the Joined line tool. Change the <B>Style</B>/<B>Fill
colour</B> to white. Then move to the middle of the Draw window
and click on one of the small grid markers. Now move up 1.5 units
and right 0.5 units and click again. Finally move down two grid
units and double-click to create a closed triangle</B>:
