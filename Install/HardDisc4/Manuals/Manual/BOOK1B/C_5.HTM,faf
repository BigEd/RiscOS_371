<HR>
All printing is handled by the <A NAME=MARKER-2-2> </A>Printer manager, !Printers. This provides an interface between your printer and the file that is being printed.<P>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-4>Before</A> you start printing, you need to set up the Printer manager so that it is using the correct printer driver for your printer and communicates correctly with it. <P>
This chapter tells you how to set up !Printers. If your printer is already set up correctly you can find out how to print files by referring to <A HREF=C_6.HTM#MARKER-9-1><I>Printing your files</I> on page 143</A>.<P>
This chapter tells you how to<P>
<UL>

<LI>set up and connect your printer<P>

<LI>choose which printer driver to use<P>

<LI>configure the printer driver.<P>

<H2> <A NAME=MARKER-9-5> </A>Setting up the <A NAME=MARKER-2-6> </A>printer</H2>
Before you can print from your computer, you need three things<P>
<UL>

<LI>a suitable printer<P>

<LI>a printer cable, with connectors for the computer and the printer<P>

<LI>an appropriate printer driver.<P>
</UL>
If you are connecting to a network printer, you'll need to make sure that you have the appropriate network connection for your computer. Contact your network manager for more information.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-14> </A>
<H3> <A NAME=MARKER-9-7> </A>Types of <A NAME=MARKER-2-8> </A>printer supported</H3>
Your supplier will advise you on suitable printers for your computer. RISC OS supports most types of popular <A NAME=MARKER-9-9> </A>dot matrix printer, Ink<A NAME=MARKER-9-10> </A>jets, as well as colour printers. It also supports laser printers compatible with the HP LaserJet as well as <A NAME=MARKER-9-11> </A>PostScript printers. <P>
The following printers are among those supported</B>:
<P>
Acorn JP150 <P>Apple PostScript printers <P>Apple ImageWriter <P>Canon Bubblejet series <P>Citizen Swift series <P>Epson EX, FX, JX &amp; LX series <P>Epson MX &amp; LQ series <P>Epson Stylus Colour <P>HP LaserJet &amp; DeskJet series <P>IBM Proprinter series <P>IBM PostScript printers <P>Integrex Colourjet <P>NEC P series <P>Olivetti JP360 <P>QMS ColourScript <P>Qume ScripTEN <P>Star DP, LC &amp; XB series <P>Star Laser Printers <P>TI OmniLaser printer <P>Most PostScript laser printers<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-18> </A>
<H4> Other printers</H4>
If your printer is not on this list, check the ReadMe files in the Printers directory to see if your printer is supported. You can also often run your printer in emulation mode. Most dot-matrix printers can emulate the Epson FX or LQ printer. Most non-PostScript laser printers can <A NAME=MARKER-9-12> </A>emulate the HP LaserJet or DeskJet printers. Read your printer's user manual for more information.<P>
!Printers also supports direct-drive printers. These are high performance printers that connect directly to the computer using an <A NAME=MARKER-9-13> </A>expansion card.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-21> </A>
<H3> Connecting the <A NAME=MARKER-2-14> </A>printer</H3>
<A NAME=HEADING5-22> </A>
<H4> Serial and parallel</H4>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMAG87" WIDTH=47 HEIGHT=45>  If you are connecting the printer directly to your computer you have two choices</B>: connection via the <A NAME=MARKER-2-15> </A>serial port or the <A NAME=MARKER-2-16> </A>parallel port. If your printer can use either type of connection, use the parallel port (it's quicker!). Your supplier will be able to advise you on which port to use.<P>
Your supplier will also be able to advise on a <A NAME=MARKER-2-17> </A>printer cable. If you are making one yourself, details of the pin connections from the computer's output ports can be found in the Welcome Guide. You will also need to consult your printer documentation for information on how to wire the connector to the printer. A standard PC (personal computer) printer cable will usually work.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-25> </A>
<H4> Network and NFS</H4>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMAG88" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=27>  If you are connected to a <A NAME=MARKER-2-18> </A>network of computers, you may have access to a network printer or printer server. Consult your network manager for more information. <P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-27> </A>
<H4> Direct drive</H4>
Direct drive <A NAME=MARKER-2-19> </A>printers connect to their own <A NAME=MARKER-2-20> </A>expansion card inside the computer. Instructions on how to fit an expansion card are given in the <I>Welcome Guide</I>.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-29> </A>
<H2> Loading the printer manager</H2>
In this section we assume that you have connected your printer to one of the communication ports on your computer or that you're using a printer on a network.<P>
The printer manager application, <A NAME=MARKER-2-21> </A>!Printers, provides an interface between the printer and your application software (an editor or word processor, for example). It's used for printing files, and to provide printer support for applications.<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMAG89" WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=35>  The printer manager uses <A NAME=MARKER-2-22> </A>printer definition files (often called <A NAME=MARKER-2-23> </A>printer drivers) to tell the computer what type of printer you are using. These files are contained in the directory <CODE>Printing.Printers</CODE>.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-33> </A>
<H3> Loading !Printers</H3>
<DL>
<DT><DD>1  <IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMAG90" WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=25>  Double-click on the <A NAME=MARKER-2-24> </A>!Printers icon (it's in the Apps icon bar directory).<P>
</DL>
After a few seconds the printer manager icon appears on the icon bar. <P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>2  Click Menu over the Printers icon on the icon bar and choose <B>Printer control</B>.<P>
</DL>
This displays the Printer control panel</B>:<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMAG91" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=53>  <P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-38> </A>
<H3> <A NAME=MARKER-9-25> </A>Loading a <A NAME=MARKER-2-26> </A>printer definition file</H3>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMAG92" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=35>  To load a printer definition file</B>:<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>1  Open the<CODE> Printing.Printers </CODE>directory.<P>
<DT><DD>2  Open the directory that corresponds with the manufacturer of your printer.<P>
<DT><DD>3  Double-click on the appropriate printer definition file.<P>
</DL>
The definition file will have a similar name to that of your printer. See <A HREF=#MARKER-9-27><I>Choosing a printer type</I></A> below.<P>
The printer name appears in the control window.<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>4  <IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMAG93" WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=38>  If you want to have more than one printer loaded, double-click on additional printer definition files.<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMAG94" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=52>  <P>
</DL>
<A NAME=HEADING5-46> </A>
<H4> <A NAME=MARKER-9-27> </A>Choosing a printer type</H4>
You should choose the <A NAME=MARKER-2-28> </A>printer definition file that is closest to the printer you have. If there isn't a file specific to your printer, you may be able to choose one that's compatible. 9-pin dot matrix printers can usually emulate the Epson FX printer, while 24-pin dot matrix printers can usually emulate the Epson LQ printer; your printer manual should give details.<P>
Non-PostScript <A NAME=MARKER-2-29> </A>laser printers can often <A NAME=MARKER-2-30> </A>emulate the HP LaserJet, or have a compatibility mode that emulates the HP LaserJet (or DeskJet); again, your printer manual should give details.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-49> </A>
<H2> Configuring the printer</H2>
After you have loaded your <A NAME=MARKER-2-31> </A>printer driver, you must choose the correct printer configuration to give the results you want.<P>
To display the configuration window, either double-click on the printer driver in the printer control window, or click Menu on the printer entry and choose <B>Configure</B>.<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMAG95" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=110>  <P>
If you want to change the <A NAME=MARKER-2-32> </A>configuration of a printer that is already on the icon bar, click on the printer icon on the bar while holding down Shift.<P>
There are three classes of <A NAME=MARKER-2-33> </A>printers</B>:<P>
<UL>

<LI>PostScript compatible printers (type PS).<P>

<LI>LaserJet and DeskJet compatible printers (type LJ).<P>

<LI>Dot matrix and Inkjet printers (type DP).<P>
</UL>
The following subsections describe how to configure each type of printer.<P>

<A NAME=HEADING5-60> </A>
<H4> Choosing the printer name and paper type</H4>
The <B>Name</B> box gives the name that will appear beneath the printer icon on the icon bar. You can change this, if you wish, or leave it blank (in which case, the name is set to the connection type, e.g. <B>Parallel</B>).<P>
The <B>Paper</B> box gives the paper size to be used by the printer. This is usually <B>A4 (Generic DP)</B>. If you want to change the paper size, click on the menu icon; this displays the <B>Paper sizes</B> menu. Choose the alternative paper size you wish to use. The correct paper sizes are marked <B>Generic DP</B>. You can also generate other page sizes using the <B>Edit paper sizes option</B> from the icon bar menu (see <A HREF=#MARKER-9-124>page 139</A>).<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-63> </A>
<H4> Printer options</H4>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMAG98" WIDTH=67 HEIGHT=85>  To display the printer <A NAME=MARKER-2-39> </A><B>Resolution</B> menu, click on the menu icon. Increasing the resolution usually gives a better quality image, but printing usually takes longer. Note that some high resolutions (e.g. 720dpi on an Epson Stylus colour printer) are only useful on special paper; see the manual supplied with your printer.<P>
To display the Paper feed menu, click on the menu icon. This menu lets you choose between Auto, Manual and Roll paper feed. Choose <B>Auto</B> if your printer has a sheet feeder or uses <A NAME=MARKER-2-41> </A>fanfold paper. Choose <B>Manual</B> if you have to insert each page by hand while printing is under way; you are prompted to insert paper at the end of each page. Choose <B>Roll</B> if your printer is using a <A NAME=MARKER-2-42> </A>paper roll.<P>
The <B>Quality</B> menu lets you choose the type of <A NAME=MARKER-2-43> </A>printout quality. Click on the menu icon to display the menu.<P>
<UL>

<LI><B>Mono</B> prints black and white output only. It does not halftone fonts or sprites; it only halftones Draw files. This is the fastest print mode.<P>

<LI><B>Grey</B> prints pictures in shades of grey. It halftones all types of files. You should always choose this option, unless speed of printing is more important than print quality, in which case choose <B>Mono</B> instead.<P>

<LI><B>Colour</B> <A NAME=MARKER-2-45> </A>prints in colour on colour printers. Only use the lower quality modes (32K or 256 colours) if you're short of memory. You'll get the best results using the 16 million colour options.<P>

<LI><B>halftoned (fine)</B> prints in 3x3 pixel halftones for grey scales and colour.<P>

<LI>halftoned prints in 6x6 pixel halftones. <B>(Large)</B> halftones give better quality than fine halftones.<P>

<LI><B>diffused </B>usually gives the best quality results, especially for grey scale pictures (try halftone, as well, though). However it takes longer to print than the halftone options.<P>
</UL>
<A NAME=HEADING5-73> </A>
<H4> Text printing options</H4>
These options control the way text is printed from an editor (such as Edit).<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMAG99" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=86>  <P>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-47> </A><B>Print title</B> puts the filename, time, date, and page number at the top of each page.<P>
<B>Print line numbers</B> puts <A NAME=MARKER-2-48> </A>line numbers at the beginning of each line.<P>
<B>Print linefeeds</B> sends a <A NAME=MARKER-2-49> </A>linefeed to the printer (as well as a carriage return) at the end of each line. If you find that your printer is producing a blank line after each line of text, you should turn this option <B>off</B>. If your printer is printing everything on one line, then you should turn this option <B>on</B>.<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMA100" WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=43>  The <B>Text quality</B> menu controls the <A NAME=MARKER-2-50> </A>quality of the output print. Text quality can be either <B>No highlights</B>, <B>draft</B> or <B>NLQ</B> (near letter quality). <A NAME=MARKER-2-51> </A>NLQ looks better but takes longer to print. (NLQ also uses more ink and wears the printer ribbon out quicker).<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMA101" WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=45>  The <B><A NAME=MARKER-2-52> </A>Control</B> <B>codes </B>menu alters the way in which text files are printed. This should normally be set to <B>Standard</B>. <B>Display</B> causes all control codes and top-bit-set characters to be printed in hexadecimal notation. <B>Ignore</B> causes all <A NAME=MARKER-2-53> </A>control codes and <A NAME=MARKER-2-54> </A>top-bit-set characters to be ignored.<P>
When you have finished configuring your printer, click on <B>OK</B>. If you want to exit without saving your changes, click on <B>Cancel</B>.<P>

The <B>Name</B> box gives the name that will appear beneath the printer icon on the icon bar. You can change this, if you wish, or leave it blank.<P>
The <B>Paper</B> box gives the paper size to be used by the printer. This is usually <B>A4 (Generic LJ)</B> in Europe; if you are using a DeskJet explicitly change this to <B>A4 (Generic DeskJet)</B>. If you want to change the paper size, click on the menu icon; this displays the <B>Paper sizes</B> menu. Choose the alternative paper size you wish to use. The paper sizes marked <B>Generic</B> <B>LJ </B>are usually best for LaserJet type printers; paper sizes marked <B>Generic DeskJet</B> are usually best for DeskJet type printers (including the Acorn JP150). It is also possible to generate other page sizes using the <B>Edit paper sizes option</B> from the icon bar menu; see <A HREF=#MARKER-9-124>page 139</A> for more details.<P>

<IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMA104" WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=45>  To display the printer <A NAME=MARKER-2-63> </A><B>Resolution</B> menu, click on the menu icon. Increasing the resolution usually gives a better quality image, but printing usually takes longer. Most modern LaserJets (and LaserJet copies and clones) can use 300x300dpi. Some early models (LaserJet and LaserJet II) do not contain enough memory to print full page graphics at full resolution; in this case use 150x150dpi or purchase more memory.<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMA105" WIDTH=54 HEIGHT=34>  To display the Paper feed menu, click on the menu icon. The menu lets you choose between Auto and Manual paper feed. Choose <B>Auto</B> if your printer has a sheet feeder or uses <A NAME=MARKER-2-64> </A>fanfold paper. Choose <B>Manual</B> if you have to insert each page by hand during printing.<P>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMA106" WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=58>  The <B>Quality</B> menu lets you choose the type of <A NAME=MARKER-2-65> </A>printout quality. Click on the menu icon to display the menu.<P>
<UL>

<LI><B><A NAME=MARKER-2-66> </A>Mono</B> prints black and white output only. It does not halftone fonts or sprites; it only <A NAME=MARKER-2-67> </A>halftones Draw files.<P>

<LI><B>Grey</B> prints pictures in shades of grey. It halftones all types of files. Unless speed of <A NAME=MARKER-2-68> </A>printing is more important than print quality, choose this in preference to <B>Mono</B>.<P>

<LI><B>Colour</B> prints in <A NAME=MARKER-2-69> </A>colour on colour printers.<P>

<LI><B>Small halftone</B> prints in 3x3 halftones for grey scales and colour. <P>

Choose <B>Verbose prologue</B> if you wish to declare all of the PostScript printer <A NAME=MARKER-2-87> </A>fonts. This option gives you the same prologue as that used by the RISC OS 2.00 printer drivers; it is included for backward compatibility only. Do not choose this option unless your application requires it.<P>
The <A NAME=MARKER-2-88> </A><B>Accent generation</B> option will automatically generate accented characters even if they are not supported by your printer. Unless you need to print unusual accented characters such as w or y circumflex (used in <A NAME=MARKER-2-89> </A>Welsh) leave Accent generation off, as it slows printing and does not work with printers with small internal memory.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-114> </A>
<H4> Text printing options</H4>
The text <A NAME=MARKER-2-90> </A>printing options allow you to control the way text is printed from an editor (such as Edit).<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMA113" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=97>  <P>
Print title puts the <A NAME=MARKER-2-91> </A>filename, time, date, and page number on each page.<P>
Print line <B>numbers</B> gives each page <A NAME=MARKER-2-92> </A>line numbers.<P>
You can adjust the size of the printed type by giving a <B><A NAME=MARKER-2-93> </A>Text</B> scale factor. PostScript printers have a wide range of available sizes, so you can scale the text from 20% to 200%. 100% gives standard sizes, 200% gives twice the size, and 50% gives half the size (twice as many characters per inch). Invalid sizes reset the text size to 100%.<P>

<H4> Printer connection options</H4>
Some of the network options may be 'greyed out' so that you cannot choose them.<P>
<B>Print in <A NAME=MARKER-2-104> </A>background</B> allows you to choose whether you want to define the printer and printing speed as a high or low priority task. If the box is ticked printing can be slower, although you can continue to use the computer while the printing takes place. If this option is not ticked, printing can be quicker, although you will usually have to wait for printing to finish before you can use the computer again. This option only works with applications that send their files to the print queue; some applications bypass the queue.<P>
<B>Parallel</B> allows you to connect a printer to the <A NAME=MARKER-2-105> </A>parallel port.<P>
<B>Serial</B> allows you to connect a printer to the <A NAME=MARKER-2-106> </A>serial port. You can set the <A NAME=MARKER-2-107> </A><B>Baud rate</B>, <A NAME=MARKER-2-108> </A><B>Data bits</B>, <A NAME=MARKER-2-109> </A><B>Parity</B>, <A NAME=MARKER-2-110> </A><B>Stop bits</B> and <A NAME=MARKER-2-111> </A><B>XON/XOFF</B>. To alter the values, click on the menu icon and choose a new value. Consult the printer manual for the correct values.<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMA118" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=71>  <P>
Net allows you to connect to a <A NAME=MARKER-2-112> </A>network printer. To use a different printer, click on the menu icon. Alternatively you can type in the name or <A NAME=MARKER-2-113> </A>station number of the printer to use. You must have a network connection to use this option. Note that this method is not used for selecting a shared printer over an Access network. See <A HREF=C_4.HTM#MARKER-9-21><I>Printing over an Acorn Access network</I> on page 108</A>.<P>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-114> </A>NFS allows you to connect to printers available on NFS networks. You cannot use this option unless you are already running Acorn's <A NAME=MARKER-2-115> </A>TCP/IP communication protocol product. For an explanation of how to fill in the NFS fields, ask your network manager. Alternatively read the TCP/IP Protocol Suite User Guide. You must have an NFS network connection to use this option.<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMA119" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=61>  <P>
File allows you to send printer <A NAME=MARKER-2-116> </A>output to a <A NAME=MARKER-2-117> </A>file. Type the name of the file into the <B>File</B> field (using the complete pathname). Alternatively click on the menu icon and drag the <B>Save as</B> box to the desired directory display; your output will now be directed to this file.<P>
<B>Append to file</B> works in connection with the <B>File</B> option. It adds printer output to the end of the file. Using this you can print several small files and produce a single file of the printed result. You must have !Printers loaded during printing, otherwise printing will over overwrite the file, rather than append to it.<P>
<B>Direct drive</B> allows you to connect a <A NAME=MARKER-2-118> </A>direct drive printer to the computer.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-146> </A>
<H4> Short-cuts</H4>
If you want to change the printer connection of a printer that is already set up on the icon bar, Shift-Adjust-click on the printer icon.<P>
If you want to change the printer configuration, Shift-click on the printer icon.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-149> </A>
<H2> Activating the printer</H2>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMA120" WIDTH=68 HEIGHT=103>  The Printer control menu allows you to make a <A NAME=MARKER-2-119> </A>printer <B>Inactive</B>, so that it can't be used and is not displayed on the icon bar. However, its settings are saved so you can used it later by simply choosing <B>Active</B>.<P>
You can <A NAME=MARKER-2-120> </A>remove a printer from the Printer control window permanently by choosing <B>Remove </B>and<B> Save choices</B>. <P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-152> </A>
<H4> Using more than one printer</H4>
If you have dragged more than one <A NAME=MARKER-2-121> </A>printer to the Printer control window you can activate them all. A printer icon is displayed on the icon bar for each active printer. This facility can be useful if you have a printer connected directly to your computer, and you also have access to another printer connected via a network.<P>
Although you can have many printers activated on the icon bar, only one of these printers is highlighted; all of the others are greyed out. When you click on the Print option in an application, the file to be printed is sent to the highlighted printer.<P>
You can choose to print using a different printer by clicking on that printer's icon on the icon bar. This highlights the new printer driver and greys out the old one.<P>
You can also print using any of the printer drivers (highlighted or not) by dragging files directly onto the desired printer's icon.<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMA121" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=40>  <P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-157> </A>
<H2> <A NAME=MARKER-9-122> </A>Saving your choices</H2>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMA122" WIDTH=76 HEIGHT=75>  You should save to disc any changes you make to the settings for your <A NAME=MARKER-2-123> </A>printer, otherwise you will have to go through the setting-up procedure again, next time you start the printer manager. To do this, choose <B>Save choices</B> from the printer icon bar menu.<P>
Once you have saved your settings to disc, the printer manager automatically loads your printer driver onto the icon bar using those settings each time you start the printer manager.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-160> </A>
<H2> <A NAME=MARKER-9-124> </A>Editing paper sizes</H2>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMA123" WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=117>  You can, if you wish, set up new page <A NAME=MARKER-2-125> </A>sizes for your printer. From the icon bar menu, display the Edit <A NAME=MARKER-2-126> </A>paper sizes dialogue box. If you use one of the standard paper sizes you need not read this section.<P>
From this dialogue box you can select your paper size by clicking on the menu icon and choosing a paper size. These are</B>:<P>
A2: 594x420mm<P>
A3: 420x297mm<P>
A4: 297x210mm (the default option)<P>
Fanfold: 279x203mm<P>
Letter: 279.4x215.9mm<P>
Legal: 355.6x215.9mm<P><IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMA124" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=224>  <P>
These are the generic types of page size. Additional sizes that fine-tune these dimensions are also given for the various printer types</B>:
<P><B>DP</B> for dot-matrix printers
<P><B>PS</B> for PostScript printers
<P><B>LJ</B> for LaserJet and DeskJet for DeskJet printers. These additional sizes define the <A NAME=MARKER-2-127> </A>Graphics and Text margins for the printers.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-170> </A>
<H3> Defining your own paper dimensions</H3>
Once you have selected your basic paper size you can fine tune it to your own requirements. Change the name in <B>Paper size name</B> and change the paper height and width if you are using a special sized paper. Finally you can change the margins within which text and graphics will be printed. Click on the <B>Save</B> box to save the new paper dimensions for future use.<P>
PostScript printers, and some other printers, need to know which tray to take paper from. This information is derived from the <B>Paper size</B> name. The name should therefore be in the form <I>paper size (name)</I>, where the paper size is the size of the paper in the paper tray. For example, <B>Letter</B> (memo-letter) will use paper in the <B>Letter tray</B>. <P>
<B>Note</B></B>: Don't use the plain paper sizes directly (A3 paper size for example); they are only given to define the basic paper size. Always use a paper size defined for a particular printer - <B>A4 (Generic DeskJet)</B>, for example.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-174> </A>
<H3> Graphics margins</H3>
The <A NAME=MARKER-2-128> </A>graphics margins must reflect the true printable area of the page (look this up in your printer manual). The margins ensure that graphics are printed properly and they are also used by applications (such as Draw). The margins correspond to those of a portrait page; landscape page values are worked out automatically. The graphics margins exist to tell the printer where to print on a piece of paper. The margins cannot be used to move the printed result around on the page.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-176> </A>
<H3> Text margins</H3>
<A NAME=MARKER-2-129> </A>Text margins are measured as relative to the printable area of the page (defined by the graphics margins). The <B>Left</B> and <B>Right</B> margins are measured in characters and the <B>Top</B> and <B>Bottom</B> margins measured in lines. The <B>Height</B> is the total number of lines on a page, including the text margins. If you want to move the position of the text output on the page, alter the text margin settings.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-178> </A>
<H4> PostScript and HP LaserJet compatible printers</H4>
For these printers, the total number of lines per page and characters per line are determined automatically.<P>
The printer is configured to use 10 characters per inch and 6 lines per inch in portrait orientation and 14 characters per inch and 8.5 lines per inch in landscape orientation.<P>
A LaserJet II cannot match these defaults exactly and uses its internal font at 10 characters per inch and 6 lines per inch in portrait orientation and 16.66 characters per inch and 8 lines per inch in landscape orientation instead.<P>
PostScript printers determine the font size from the <B>Text scale</B> and <B>Text columns</B> values in the <B>Configure</B> dialogue box.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-183> </A>
<H4> Changing the page length on Dot-matrix printers</H4>
If you require an unusual page length you should set it by altering the Text margins Height box, as well as the Graphics margins. For example, if you are printing labels, you may have six rows of labels on a sheet of A4 paper. Set the Text height to be something like 11 lines so that the printer will form feed to the start of the next label correctly. This is because the Text height is used to tell the printer how long the paper is for both text and graphics printing.<P>

<H3> Saving your <A NAME=MARKER-10-130> </A>choices</H3>
<IMG SRC="PICS2/C5IMA125" WIDTH=76 HEIGHT=75>  To save any changes you make in the <B>Page size</B> dialogue box, click on <B>Save</B>; this saves them to disc. If you wish to save the changes permanently, you should click on the <B>Save choices</B> option in the icon bar menu.<P>
If you wish you can delete a paper size by selecting it and then clicking on<B> Delete paper size. </B>You can only delete sizes that you have created or altered.<P>
<A NAME=HEADING5-188> </A>
<H2> Creating your own Printer definition file</H2>
You can create a <A NAME=MARKER-2-131> </A>Printer definition file that is specifically tailored for your printer. <I>PrintEdit</I> allows you to create a new printer driver (see <A HREF=C_7.HTM#MARKER-9-1>page 151</A>).<P>
